# Anachron

A time-travel survival game where you're lost in history with modern technology, seeking happiness until you choose to stay.

## The Premise

Twenty-four. Stanford. Six figures. A life that looks perfect and feels like nothing.

So when the lab needed a volunteer for the time machine's first human trial, you stepped up without thinking. Thirty seconds into the past. What could go wrong?

Everything, it turns out. The machine is broken. You can't go home.

**The question**: When do you stop jumping? When have you built enough to stay?

## Core Mechanics

### Region Selection

At the start, choose your historical focus:
- **European Focus**: Ancient Greece, Vikings, Medieval Europe, Colonial America, Industrial Britain, World Wars
- **World Explorer**: All eras including Egypt, China, Aztec Empire, Mughal India, and more

### The Time Machine

A small device you wear on your wrist (hidden under your sleeve):
- **Display**: Shows current date and location
- **Indicator**: Pulses when a travel window approaches
  - Dark = window is far off
  - Bright pulse = window is OPEN

Windows open after you've been in an era for about a year. When open, you have a few turns to decide. Time compresses during this decision—turns represent days instead of weeks.

The time machine **always works cleanly** when activated. No malfunctions, no drama around the mechanism. The drama is in what you leave behind.

### Your Items

You always have exactly three items:
1. **Bottle of Ibuprofen** (100 tablets) - Fever reducer, pain relief, seems miraculous
2. **Swiss Army Knife** - Multi-tool with blade, scissors, screwdriver
3. **Smartphone + Solar Charger** - Offline Wikipedia, camera, flashlight, calculator, compass

These are obviously anachronistic. Using them has risks and rewards. They travel with you always.

### Fulfillment Anchors (Hidden)

The game tracks three invisible dimensions:

- **Belonging**: Community, acceptance, found family
- **Legacy**: Lasting impact, teaching, building
- **Freedom**: Autonomy, self-determination

These are NEVER shown as meters. You discover your path through play. When you've built enough on any anchor, staying becomes meaningful.

### Time Pacing

- **Normal turns**: ~6-8 weeks each (7 turns = 1 year)
- **Window open**: Time compresses, turns = days
- **First year**: Window stays closed, giving you time to settle

### Finding Happiness (Win Condition)

When the window opens and you've built a meaningful life, you'll have the option to **stay forever**. This ends the game—you've chosen your home.

Your final score is calculated based on:
- **Survival**: How many turns you survived
- **Exploration**: How many eras you visited
- **Fulfillment**: Your belonging, legacy, and freedom scores
- **Ending Bonus**: Based on what you achieved

The leaderboard tracks the greatest journeys.

## Saved Data

The game saves your progress locally:
- **leaderboard.json**: High scores with blurbs describing each journey
- **game_history.json**: Full narrative of every playthrough

You can open `game_history.json` to re-read your past adventures.

### Key Files to Tweak

**Timing & windows?** → `config.py`: `WINDOW_MIN_TURNS`, probability settings
**Starting items?** → `config.py`: `STARTING_ITEMS`
**AI behavior?** → `prompts.py`
**Add eras?** → `eras.py`
**Scoring weights?** → `scoring.py`

## Running the Game

```bash
# Requires Python 3.8+
pip install anthropic  # For AI narrative

cd anachron
python game.py
```

Without the Anthropic API, runs in demo mode with placeholder narrative.

## Design Philosophy

1. **The machine is both salvation and curse**: It lets you escape, but escape has costs
2. **Happiness is discovered, not announced**: No "you win" screen—just the choice to stay
3. **The decision is the drama**: The time machine always works; the question is whether to use it
4. **Time compresses around decisions**: The window opening creates urgency
5. **Each jump gets heavier**: The more you build, the more leaving costs
