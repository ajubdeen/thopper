The acrid smell of olive oil, sweat, and human waste assaults your nostrils. Voices echo in rapid, melodic Greek around you—real ancient Greek, not the classroom pronunciation you half-remember.\n\nYou've materialized in what looks like a marketplace. Clay amphoras tower beside you, their surfaces painted with dancing figures. Men in rough wool tunics stare at your jeans and sneakers with growing suspicion. A woman draped head-to-toe in fabric hurries past, eyes averted. The Athenian agora stretches before you—columns, statues, and crowds of citizens debating loudly near a marble building that must be the Bouleuterion.\n\nA stocky man with a graying beard approaches, speaking rapid Greek. His tone shifts from curious to concerned as he gestures at your strange clothes. Others are gathering. A few point and mutter \"barbaros\"—barbarian. Your hand instinctively moves to your hidden wrist device, but the indicator remains dark. No escape yet.\n\nThe bearded man repeats a question you don't understand, but his gestures suggest he's asking your name and origin. The crowd grows restless. Someone mentions \"Scythian\" while examining your synthetic fabrics with suspicion.\n\n[A] Claim to be \"Alexios\" from a distant Greek colony, hoping your modern pronunciation passes for an unfamiliar dialect while you figure out the local customs.\n\n[B] Present yourself as a traveling philosopher from the far north, using your smartphone's hidden knowledge to quote genuine philosophical fragments that won't be \"invented\" for decades.\n\n[C] Gesture that you're a mute foreign craftsman and demonstrate your Swiss Army knife's superior metalwork to establish value as an artisan.\n\n<anchors>belonging[0] legacy[0] freedom[0]</anchors>\n\n\"Alexios,\" you say, the name feeling strange on your tongue. \"From... Tanais.\" You gesture vaguely northeast, naming the distant Greek colony on the Black Sea that you hope exists by now. The bearded man—who introduces himself as Kleomenes—nods thoughtfully. Your pronunciation is odd, but he attributes it to barbaric influence from the Scythian steppes.\n\nOver the following weeks, your story holds better than you dared hope. Kleomenes, a pottery merchant, takes pity on what he sees as a fellow Greek fallen on hard times far from home. He offers you work hauling clay and tending his kiln in exchange for a straw mat in his workshop and one meal daily. Your modern clothes mysteriously \"wear out,\" replaced by a rough wool chiton that marks your humble station.\n\nThe work is backbreaking, but you learn the rhythms of Athenian life. Citizens gather each morning in the agora to debate politics and philosophy. You catch fragments—tensions with Sparta, arguments over the tribute collected from subject cities, whispers about Pericles' ambitious building projects. Your hands blister and callus, but your modern ibuprofen keeps the pain manageable when Kleomenes isn't watching.\n\nAs autumn arrives, opportunity presents itself. Kleomenes mentions that his brother Nikias has connections to the silver mines at Laurion—always needing trusted overseers who can read and write. Alternatively, the upcoming Panathenaic festival will bring wealthy visitors seeking quality pottery. Or you could approach the philosophical circles you've observed, where foreign wisdom is sometimes valued.\n\n[A] Pursue the overseer position at the silver mines, where your modern knowledge of safety and efficiency could prove valuable—and profitable.\n\n[B] Help Kleomenes expand his pottery business for the festival, using your hidden smartphone to calculate optimal pricing and predict wealthy buyers' preferences.\n\n[C] Seek out the philosophers in the agora, particularly the circle around Socrates, where you could carefully introduce mathematical concepts from your era as \"insights from Scythian wise men.\"\n\n<anchors>belonging[+5] legacy[0] freedom[-3]</anchors>\n\n[Journey abandoned]"
