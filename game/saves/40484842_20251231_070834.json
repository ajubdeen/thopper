  "last_narrative": "You snatch the phone and bolt toward the gates, your heart hammering against your ribs. The young monks shout in alarm, but fortune favors your desperate sprint - their heavy robes and sandals aren't built for pursuit, and years of contemplative life haven't prepared them for chasing fleeing strangers.\n\nYou burst through the monastery's wooden gates just as a merchant caravan is departing. The timing couldn't be better - the traders' pack animals and wagons create perfect chaos to hide your escape. You duck behind a loaded ox-cart, gasping as the monks appear at the gates, scanning the crowd with confused expressions.\n\nThe caravan master, a weathered man with intelligent eyes, notices your distress but doesn't seem alarmed. \"Troubles with the brothers?\" he asks in accented but understandable German. \"They mean well, but sometimes strangers find their... curiosity overwhelming.\" His knowing smile suggests this isn't the first time someone has fled the monastery in haste.\n\nOver the following weeks, you integrate yourself into Heinrich's trading company. Your modern medical knowledge proves invaluable when his oxen develop infections and when dysentery strikes the camp. The ibuprofen, carefully rationed and presented as \"rare Eastern remedies,\" establishes your reputation as a healer worth protecting.\n\nYour strange clothes become less conspicuous as you acquire period-appropriate garments through trade. Heinrich appreciates having someone who can read Latin inscriptions and help negotiate with monastery scribes along their route. Your smartphone remains hidden but functional - its offline Wikipedia becomes your secret guide to medieval customs and dangers.\n\nThe caravan follows well-established trade routes between monasteries and market towns. You're learning the rhythms of 13th-century commerce while your true identity remains safely concealed among fellow travelers who ask few questions about each other's pasts.\n\n[A] Offer to help Heinrich establish a permanent trading post in one of the larger towns - use your knowledge of future trade routes to suggest profitable locations\n\n[B] Volunteer to serve as the caravan's scribe and translator - monasteries always need documents copied and your literacy could earn steady income\n\n[C] Propose joining a pilgrimage route as a guide for religious travelers - your \"healing knowledge\" would be valuable for the long journeys to holy sites\n\n",

Father O'Brien introduces you as \"Michael\" - a good Catholic name for someone seeking a fresh start. The parish community, desperate to prove their patriotism and Christian charity, embraces you warmly. Mrs. Kowalski brings you her late husband's work clothes. The Rosetti family shares their Sunday dinner.

The parish women cluck over your thin frame, constantly offering food despite rationing. Your mysterious past becomes romantic rather than suspicious - a brave soul who escaped Hitler's persecution to fight for freedom.\n\nThe other boarders at Mrs. Chen's now nod respectfully when you pass.

Together, you construct the story of Mikhail Kowalsky - a Polish medical student whose family was killed in the Warsaw Ghetto uprising. The trauma caused selective amnesia, explaining your gaps in memory. Your medical knowledge comes from interrupted university studies. Your strange arrival stems from months of wandering after escaping a work camp.\n\nThe timing proves fortuitous. News of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising has just reached American newspapers, generating tremendous sympathy for Polish survivors. Father O'Brien presents your \"recovered memories\" to Mrs. Whitfield as a breakthrough achieved through spiritual counseling and prayer - a miracle of faith healing psychological wounds.\n\nOver the following weeks, your story gains credibility. The Polish families in the parish embrace you as a survivor of unimaginable horror. Mrs. Kowalski weeps when she hears your \"memories\" of her homeland's suffering. Dr. Brennan, moved by your tragic backstory, offers to help you complete medical training through a refugee assistance program.\n\nThe Red Cross investigation transforms from suspicion to sympathy. Mrs. Whitfield, now viewing you as a heroic survivor rather than a security risk, fast-tracks your application. Your \"trauma-induced amnesia\" explains every inconsistency in your earlier statements.\n\nYour position strengthens dramatically. Sullivan promotes you at the metalworks after hearing your story. The parish ladies compete to care for \"poor Mikhail who lost everything.\" Even the suspicious Mrs. Henderson now speaks of you as \"that brave Polish boy who escaped the Nazis.\"\n\nAs spring arrives in 1944, Father O'Brien smiles during confession. \"God works in mysterious ways, Mikhail. Your new life is taking root.\"\n\n[A] Accept Dr. Brennan's offer to train as a medical assistant - use your knowledge to help with the expected influx of wounded soldiers\n\n[B] Propose starting a support group for other refugees and trauma survivors - build a community of displaced persons\n\n[C] Volunteer to help with war bond drives using your story as inspiration - become a public speaker for the war effort\n\n<anchors>belonging[+15] legacy[+8] freedom[-5]</anchors>"

Your talks raise steady money for the war effort - not spectacular amounts, but respectable contributions that help quota goals. The story resonates because it's personal, immediate, and connects local sacrifice to overseas suffering.\n\nThe speaking circuit becomes routine. You develop polished anecdotes, learn to pace emotional moments, understand which details move different audiences. Factory workers respond to stories of Nazi labor camps. Church groups connect with accounts of faith sustaining hope. Mothers relate to your grief over lost family.\n\nAs summer deepens in 1944, your reputation as \"the Polish speaker\" spreads beyond the immediate area. Other parishes request your testimony. The county war bond committee adds you to their regular roster.
