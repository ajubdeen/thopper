        "narrative": "The world lurches sideways and your stomach drops through dimensions you didn't know existed. One moment you're in your Palo Alto lab, the next you're stumbling across frost-hard ground that shouldn't exist. The acrid smell of wood smoke and something else—unwashed bodies, animal hides, human waste—hits you like a physical blow. Your jeans and sneakers feel impossibly alien against the morning cold.\n\nVoices cut through the mist ahead. Harsh, guttural sounds that might be words. Through the gray dawn, you make out low wooden buildings with sod roofs, smoke curling from holes in their peaks. A woman emerges from the largest structure, her woolen dress reaching her ankles, iron keys jangling from her belt. She stops dead when she sees you, her weathered face cycling through confusion, suspicion, and something that might be fear.\n\n\"Úti maðr,\" she calls sharply to someone inside. Outlander. Even through your panic, you recognize the Old Norse from your college linguistics courses. More figures appear—men with scraggly beards, hands resting on knife hilts. Their eyes scan your strange clothes, your soft unmarked hands, the obvious wealth of your woven fabrics. In this world, you realize with growing dread, strangers either bring trade or trouble.\n\nThe woman barks something at you, her tone demanding. You don't understand the words, but her meaning is clear: explain yourself, or face the consequences.\n\n[A] Fall to your knees and gesture toward the sky, claiming to be a lost traveler blessed by the gods\n\n[B] Point to your mouth and stomach, acting mute but hungry—the universal language of need\n\n[C] Slowly reveal your Swiss Army knife and offer it as a gift, showing you come bearing valuable trade goods\n\n<anchors>belonging[0] legacy[0] freedom[0]</anchors>\n\nYou drop to your knees on the frozen earth, arms raised toward the gray sky. \"Gods... blessed by the gods,\" you manage in broken Old Norse, your voice cracking with desperation. The words feel clumsy on your tongue, but the woman's eyes narrow with interest rather than dismissal.\n\nThen disaster strikes. As you gesture skyward, your sleeve rides up, revealing the time machine's sleek metal band around your wrist. The morning light catches its alien surface—too smooth, too perfect, clearly forged by no earthly smith. Gasps ripple through the gathering crowd. Someone shouts \"Seiðmaðr!\"—sorcerer. The woman stumbles backward, her face twisting with terror and rage.\n\nOver the following weeks, your situation becomes precarious. They name you \"Eirikr the Strange-Armed\" and treat you with the careful distance reserved for those touched by dangerous magic. The jarl, Thorvald Iron-Fist, allows you to shelter in his hall but watches you constantly. Your claims of divine blessing backfired—they believe you practice seiðr, the feminine magic that honorable men should shun. Some mutter about blood eagles and ritual sacrifice.\n\nYou've learned enough of their tongue to understand the whispers. The völva, the ancient seeress named Ragnhild, arrives next week for the winter blót. She'll examine you, they say. If she declares you cursed or an enemy of the gods, Thorvald will have little choice but to act. The jarl's own reputation hangs on maintaining the gods' favor for his people.\n\nAs frost deepens into true winter, you realize you're running out of time. The hall grows colder each night, and suspicious glances follow your every move.\n\n[A] Offer to prove your worth through combat in the training yard, showing you're a warrior despite the strange magic\n\n[B] Seek out the völva before she arrives and attempt to convince her privately that you serve the gods\n\n[C] Demonstrate knowledge of the coming seasons and harvests, positioning yourself as a valuable oracle rather than a threat\n\n<anchors>belonging[-5] legacy[0] freedom[-10]</anchors>\n\nYou slip away from Thorvald's hall on a bitter morning, following rumors to a sacred grove three miles upriver where Ragnhild communes with the spirits. The ancient völva sits beside a spring that never freezes, her weathered hands weaving patterns in the steam that rises from the dark water. When she sees you approach, her pale eyes show no surprise—as if she's been expecting you.\n\n\"So,\" she says in a voice like wind through dry leaves, \"the strange-armed one seeks wisdom before judgment.\" You kneel respectfully and speak carefully in your improving Norse, explaining that the gods sent you from a distant land with knowledge to help her people. To your amazement, she listens without scorn. When you mention dreams of great ships crossing western seas—knowledge from your phone's Wikipedia of Viking exploration—her eyes sharpen with genuine interest.\n\nOver the weeks that follow, Ragnhild becomes your unlikely protector. She declares to the hall that you carry \"far-sight,\" a gift from Odin the Wanderer himself. The jarl's suspicion transforms into cautious respect when your predictions about weather patterns prove uncannily accurate. Your status shifts from dangerous outsider to valuable oddity. The völva teaches you proper rituals, and in return, you share carefully chosen glimpses of distant lands and future seasons.\n\nAs winter deepens toward the longest night, Thorvald faces a crucial decision. Norwegian jarls loyal to Harald Fairhair have sent word—they demand tribute and warriors for spring raids, or they'll come to collect both by force. The hall buzzes with nervous energy as free farmers debate whether to submit, flee, or fight. Your strange knowledge has earned you a voice in these discussions, but now they expect wisdom that could determine their survival.\n\nThorvald approaches you after the evening meal, mead-heavy and troubled. \"Strange one,\" he says, \"your sight reaches far.
