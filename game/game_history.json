        "narrative": "The world lurches sideways and your stomach drops as if you've fallen off a cliff. One moment you were in your garage in Palo Alto, the next you're stumbling onto sun-baked stone, ears ringing from the transition. The acrid smell of olive oil, sweat, and something else—human waste?—hits you like a wall. Your jeans and t-shirt feel absurdly out of place as sandaled feet shuffle past, their owners draped in rough wool and linen.\n\nYou're in some kind of marketplace. Men in short tunics argue over clay amphorae while women peer from beneath veils. The Greek you studied in college comes flooding back as you catch fragments: \"...silver from Laurion...\" \"...ships from Egypt...\" A few people stare at your strange clothes, whispering. One bearded man points and says something about \"barbarian cloth.\"\n\nYour heart hammers as you realize how exposed you are. These people have never seen denim, never seen a printed t-shirt. A small crowd begins to gather, their voices rising. Someone mentions taking you to the archons—the magistrates. You catch the word \"spy\" and \"Persian.\" The second Persian War only ended a generation ago. Being mistaken for an enemy could be fatal.\n\nA muscular man with calloused hands steps closer, speaking slowly as if to a child: \"Who are you, stranger? What polis do you serve?\" The crowd presses in, waiting for your answer. You need to respond quickly before this escalates.\n\n[A] Claim to be a traveling merchant from a distant land beyond their knowledge, hoping your strange goods will seem valuable rather than suspicious.\n\n[B] Pretend to be a shipwrecked survivor who has lost everything, appealing to Greek hospitality customs toward suppliants.\n\n[C] Present yourself as a philosopher seeking wisdom, knowing that Athens respects intellectual visitors and foreign teachers.\n\n<anchors>belonging[0] legacy[0] freedom[0]</anchors>\n\nYou drop to your knees on the rough stone, arms outstretched in the formal posture of a suppliant. \"I throw myself upon your mercy,\" you cry out in halting Greek. \"My ship foundered in a storm—everything lost to Poseidon's fury. I am Xenios, cast upon your shores with nothing but my life.\"\n\nThe crowd's mood shifts instantly. Several men step back, making the sign against evil. In Greek culture, suppliants are sacred—to harm one risks the gods' wrath. The muscular man who questioned you now looks troubled rather than suspicious. \"Stranger, if you truly seek Zeus Xenios's protection...\" He glances at the others, then nods slowly. \"I am Kleomenes, potter of the Kerameikos. My wife will not forgive me if I turn away one blessed by the god of hospitality.\"\n\nOver the following weeks, your gambit pays off beyond your wildest hopes. Kleomenes and his family take you in, providing food, shelter, and rough clothing that helps you blend in. His wife Penthesilea treats you kindly but keeps her distance—proper for a woman with a strange man in the house. Their teenage son Nikias becomes fascinated by your odd accent and occasional slips into concepts that don't exist yet. You learn the rhythm of Athenian life: the agora's bustle, the workshops' hammer-song, the evening symposiums where men recline and debate philosophy over wine.\n\nBut as the season turns toward autumn, questions multiply. Other potters ask about your family, your polis, your training. Your story of shipwreck explains your lack of possessions, but not your ignorance of basic pottery techniques or your strange knowledge of distant places. When you accidentally mention concepts like \"democracy in the future\" or reference events that haven't happened yet, people exchange worried glances.\n\nOne evening, Kleomenes pulls you aside. \"Friend Xenios, there are whispers. Some say you speak like an oracle—knowing things you shouldn't know. Others wonder if you're a Persian spy with an elaborate story. I believe in your shipwreck, but you must establish yourself properly in Athens, or suspicion will grow dangerous.\"\n\n[A] Seek work in the silver mines at Laurion, where desperate men ask few questions and your strange knowledge might help you survive the brutal conditions.\n\n[B] Offer your services to the city as a foreign teacher, following the tradition of wise men like Anaxagoras who came from abroad to educate Athenian youth.\n\n[C] Approach the temple of Hephaestus near the Agora, claiming the god of craftsmanship sent you visions in dreams—explaining your odd knowledge while gaining religious protection.\n\n<anchors>belonging[+5] legacy[0] freedom[-3]</anchors>\n\nYour decision to present yourself as a teacher proves inspired. Kleomenes introduces you to Hipponikos, a wealthy citizen whose son needs tutoring in mathematics and natural philosophy. When you demonstrate your knowledge—casually explaining geometric principles that won't be \"discovered\" for decades and discussing the movements of celestial bodies with startling precision—Hipponikos's eyes widen with genuine amazement.\n\n\"By the gods,\" he whispers after you predict a lunar eclipse to the day. \"You truly are touched by divine wisdom.\" Word spreads quickly through Athens's elite circles. The foreign teacher who knows impossible things becomes the season's fascination. Wealthy families compete to hire you, and your rates climb steadily.\n\nOver the following weeks, your reputation solidifies. You're careful to frame your knowledge as \"dreams from Apollo\" or \"visions granted by Athena,\" which satisfies Greek curiosity about your impossible insights. Your students include the sons of prominent citizens—young men who will shape Athens's future. When you subtly introduce concepts of hygiene to prevent disease, or demonstrate principles of engineering that could improve their siege engines, they hang on every word.\n\nThe money flows freely now. You've moved into your own modest house near the Agora, with a slave named Thrax to manage household duties. Your success, however, draws unexpected attention. As winter approaches, a messenger arrives with an invitation that makes your blood run cold: Pericles himself requests your presence. The most powerful man in Athens has heard of the foreign teacher with impossible knowledge.\n\n\"The strategos wishes to discuss philosophy,\" the messenger explains. \"He's particularly interested in your... unique perspectives on statecraft and the future of Athens.\" But there's something in his tone that suggests this isn't merely social curiosity. Pericles is brilliant, suspicious, and utterly ruthless with threats to Athenian power.\n\n[A] Accept the invitation immediately, bringing gifts and demonstrating complete deference to avoid seeming like a threat to his authority.\n\n[B] Request a delay to properly prepare, using the time to research Pericles' current political challenges so you can offer genuinely useful advice.\n\n[C] Approach Aspasia first—as Pericles' foreign-born partner, she understands the delicate position of influential outsiders and might provide crucial guidance.\n\n<anchors>belonging[+8] legacy[+12] freedom[-5]</anchors>\n\nYour attempt to reach Aspasia proves more complicated than expected. As a foreign woman, even one of her stature, she doesn't move freely through Athens like a citizen male. Your first inquiries at symposiums are met with raised eyebrows—respectable men don't discuss seeking private audience with another man's hetaira, even one as intellectually renowned as Aspasia.\n\nWhen you finally make contact through a chain of intermediaries, the meeting itself becomes problematic. Aspasia agrees to see you, but only in the presence of other women at a religious festival honoring Demeter. The conversation must be carefully coded, speaking in metaphors about \"navigating storms\" and \"foreign seeds taking root in Attic soil.\" She's brilliant and immediately grasps your situation, but warns that your approach has already created gossip.\n\n\"Pericles has heard you sought me out before answering his summons,\" she says quietly, pretending to examine votive offerings. \"He sees this as either clever—understanding the value of counsel—or suspicious—foreign conspirators conferring in secret.\" Her dark eyes meet yours briefly. \"Your reputation for impossible knowledge already troubles him. Some whisper you're a Persian mystic sent to bewitch Athenian minds.\"\n\nOver the following weeks, the delay costs you. While you waited for the meeting with Aspasia, then processed her advice, Pericles' invitation has transformed into something more formal and less friendly. The summons now comes through official channels, couched in language that suggests investigation rather than philosophical discourse. Your students' families begin expressing quiet concerns. The wealthy Hipponikos mentions that \"certain citizens\" have questioned your loyalty to Athens.\n\nYet Aspasia's counsel proves invaluable. She's given you crucial intelligence: Pericles fears that Sparta is infiltrating Athens with foreign agents posing as teachers and philosophers. Your timing couldn't be worse—or perhaps more revealing of your true nature.\n\n[A] Present yourself to Pericles with complete honesty about your origins, gambling that the impossible truth might be more believable than any lie.\n\n[B] Offer to prove your loyalty by providing intelligence about Spartan military tactics, using your historical knowledge to give Athens genuine strategic advantages.\n\n[C] Propose hosting a public demonstration of your teaching methods in the Theater of Dionysus, letting all citizens witness your wisdom and judge your character openly—following the Athenian tradition of deciding important matters through public scrutiny.\n\n<anchors>belonging[+3] legacy[+5] freedom[-8]</anchors>\n\nYour meeting with Pericles in his private study begins promisingly. When you offer detailed knowledge of Spartan military formations—describing their phalanx tactics, the organization of their army by age groups, and weaknesses in their siege capabilities—his sharp eyes gleam with interest. But your luck sours when you reveal too much too quickly.\n\n\"Fascinating,\" Pericles says, leaning forward. \"Tell me, how does a shipwrecked teacher know that Sparta trains their warriors in groups of thirty-five, when our own spies report conflicting numbers?\" His voice grows dangerously quiet. \"And how do you know about their new iron-working techniques from the Messenian helots? That intelligence only reached us three days ago through... very specific channels.\"\n\nThe trap snaps shut around you. Your historical knowledge, meant to prove loyalty, instead reveals impossible accuracy about current military secrets. Pericles summons two guards, and suddenly you're not a honored guest but a suspected spy under house arrest. Over the following weeks, as winter deepens, investigators comb through your life in Athens. They question your students, examine your teaching methods, and press Kleomenes about your early days in the city.\n\nThe accusations multiply beyond your control. Someone claims they saw you making strange marks—your occasional notes in English alphabet. Another swears you predicted a grain shipment's arrival date with suspicious precision. Your former patron Hipponikos, fearing association with a traitor, publicly distances himself. Students' families cancel their contracts. The comfortable life you built crumbles as Athens' paranoia focuses on you.\n\nYet you're not entirely powerless. Your house arrest is loose—more surveillance than imprisonment—and you still have allies. Thrax, your household slave, remains loyal and serves as messenger. Some of your former students quietly express doubt about the charges. Aspasia, through careful intermediaries, hints that not everyone in Pericles' circle believes you're a threat.\n\n[A] Attempt to escape Athens entirely, using your knowledge of the countryside and historical events to evade pursuit and seek refuge in a neutral polis.\n\n[B] Demand trial by jury in the Athenian courts, trusting that your reputation as a teacher and the weakness of evidence might sway the democratic assembly.\n\n[C] Offer to submit to the sacred test of the Delphic Oracle, proposing that Apollo himself judge your innocence—a gambit that would either vindicate you completely or destroy you utterly.\n\n<anchors>belonging[-5] legacy[-3] freedom[-10]</anchors>\n\nYour escape from Athens begins well enough. Thrax helps you slip away during a religious procession when your watchers are distracted, and your knowledge of ancient geography serves you initially. You know which mountain passes lead to neutral territories, which roads the Athenians patrol most heavily. But your luck falters when winter storms strike earlier than expected, turning familiar paths into treacherous mud and forcing you to take shelter in villages where strangers draw unwanted attention.\n\nThe delay proves costly. In a small farming settlement near Megara, your accent and inability to explain your presence convincingly raises suspicions. The village headman, loyal to Athens and eager to curry favor, sends word of the suspicious foreigner matching the description of Pericles' escaped prisoner. By the time you realize your mistake and flee, Athenian cavalry are already riding hard along the coastal roads.\n\nOver the following weeks, you're reduced to hiding in caves and olive groves, scavenging what food you can. Your modern clothes, long since replaced by Greek garb, can't protect you from the mountain cold. The Swiss Army knife proves invaluable for survival tasks, but you're always one step ahead of pursuit. Twice you barely avoid Athenian search parties by hiding in sacred groves where soldiers won't enter after dark.\n\nAs spring arrives, your situation grows desperate rather than better. You're branded an outlaw throughout Attica, cut off from civilized shelter. Wild animals and bandits pose constant threats in the remote areas where you're forced to hide. Your smartphone's battery, even with the solar charger, runs dangerously low from overuse of the compass function during nighttime navigation.\n\nBut opportunity comes from an unexpected source. While foraging near the border with Boeotia, you encounter a group of Theban merchants whose cart has broken down. Their leader, Aristomenes, eyes you warily but seems more interested in your obvious desperation than any bounty on your head.\n\n\"You have the look of a man with nothing left to lose,\" he observes. \"Such men can be useful, if they're willing to work for honest silver rather than steal it.\"\n\n[A] Offer your services as a guide and translator for their trading expeditions, using your geographical knowledge to help them find profitable new routes.\n\n[B] Propose to teach their children and household slaves to read and write, establishing yourself as a valuable asset worth protecting from Athenian pursuit.\n\n[C] Suggest they hire you to help negotiate with the Oracle at Delphi on their behalf, knowing that your \"divine visions\" could provide the merchants with seemingly prophetic guidance for their business ventures.\n\n<anchors>belonging[-8] legacy[-5] freedom[+12]</anchors>\n\nYour gambit with Aristomenes pays off spectacularly. When you guide his caravan to a previously unknown river crossing that saves them three days of travel, then help them avoid bandits by suggesting an alternate route through sacred groves, the Theban merchant becomes convinced you're blessed by Hermes, god of travelers and trade. Your knowledge of ancient geography—where settlements will grow, which mountain passes stay clear longest—seems like divine inspiration to men who navigate by landmarks and local reputation.\n\nWithin weeks, you've become invaluable to his trading network. You lead them to deposits of high-quality clay that potters will prize, guide them to fishing villages with abundant catches perfect for inland markets, and most lucratively, direct them to communities with surplus grain just as other cities face shortages. Your smartphone's offline maps, carefully consulted in private, reveal mineral deposits and geographic features that won't be discovered for centuries.\n\nOver the following months, as spring turns to summer, your reputation spreads through Boeotian merchant circles. You're known as \"Xenios the Far-Seer,\" the foreign guide whose routes never fail. The silver flows freely—enough to buy proper clothes, weapons, and your own pack animals. More importantly, you've earned protection. When Athenian agents inquire about a fugitive teacher, Theban merchants claim they've never heard of such a man. They only know a valuable trading partner who brings them profit.\n\nThe work suits you in ways you hadn't expected. Days on mountain trails, nights around campfires sharing stories with hardened traders, the satisfaction of successful negotiations in foreign markets—it's a life of constant movement and challenge. Yet as autumn approaches, Aristomenes makes an offer that could change everything.\n\n\"The Pythian Games approach at Delphi,\" he says over evening wine. \"All the great merchants will gather, along with representatives from every polis. It's dangerous for you—Athens will have agents there—but also an opportunity. If you could guide our expedition to victory in the trade competitions, we'd all be rich beyond measure.\"\n\n[A] Accept the challenge and travel to Delphi, using your knowledge of historical events to help the merchants succeed at the games despite the risk of Athenian discovery.\n\n[B] Propose establishing a permanent trading post in a remote but strategically located valley, creating a safe base of operations while building something lasting.\n\n[C] Suggest forming an alliance with the Delphic priests by offering to interpret \"divine signs\" for pilgrims, knowing that religious sanctuary could protect you from political enemies while legitimizing your prophetic abilities.\n\n<anchors>belonging[+12] legacy[+8] freedom[+3]</anchors>\n\nYour proposal to establish a permanent trading post excites Aristomenes and his partners. You identify a perfect valley—defensible, with fresh water and natural shelter, positioned along a route that will become crucial in future conflicts. The merchants pool their silver to purchase the land from local farmers, and construction begins with high hopes. Your knowledge of engineering principles helps design storage facilities and defensive walls that impress even experienced builders.\n\nBut the venture quickly encounters problems you couldn't foresee. The local Boeotian council, initially welcoming, grows suspicious when they realize how strategically valuable your chosen location truly is. They demand additional tribute payments and impose restrictions on which goods can be stored there. Worse, the farmers you displaced prove more troublesome than expected—several have relatives in positions of minor authority who begin questioning why foreigners should control such prime territory.\n\nOver the following weeks, as winter sets in, the complications multiply. A harsh early freeze destroys much of the construction work, splitting timber and cracking newly-laid stone foundations. The costs spiral beyond the merchants' initial investment, forcing them to take on debt with Theban moneylenders at ruinous interest rates. Some of your trading partners begin grumbling that the \"Far-Seer's\" vision has led them into a costly trap.\n\nMost dangerously, the attention drawn by your ambitious project reaches unwelcome ears. A Spartan envoy, traveling through Boeotia on diplomatic business, takes particular interest in your fortified trading post so close to Attica's border. He asks pointed questions about the foreign architect who designed such sophisticated defenses. Meanwhile, Athenian merchants visiting Theban markets hear rumors of a mysterious trader whose geographical knowledge seems impossibly precise.\n\nYour time machine indicator, dark for months, suddenly pulses with faint light as you examine the half-built walls in the morning frost. The window isn't open yet, but something has changed. The device seems to respond to moments of transition, of choices that define who you become.\n\nAristomenes approaches with grim news. \"The Spartans are asking too many questions,\" he says quietly. \"And our Theban creditors grow impatient. We need a solution, friend, before this venture ruins us all.\"\n\n[A] Cut your losses and dissolve the partnership, distributing what assets remain and scattering to different cities before the political heat intensifies.\n\n[B] Double down by recruiting skilled craftsmen and former soldiers to turn the trading post into a proper fortress-town, creating something too valuable for any power to destroy.\n\n[C] Invoke the ancient Greek tradition of establishing an emporion—a neutral trading sanctuary under divine protection—by dedicating the post to Hermes and seeking recognition from the Amphictyonic League.\n\n<anchors>belonging[+8] legacy[+15] freedom[-12]</anchors>\n\nYour gambit to invoke divine protection proves moderately successful. The formal dedication to Hermes provides exactly the political cover you hoped for—neither Sparta nor Athens can openly threaten a sanctified trading post without risking the gods' wrath. The Amphictyonic League, after lengthy deliberation and generous offerings, grants limited recognition to your emporion. The sacred boundaries are marked with stone herms, and a small shrine to Hermes Agoraios rises at the settlement's heart.\n\nHowever, the process consumes months of negotiations and nearly bankrupts your merchant partners. The required offerings, ceremonial feasts, and bribes to various officials drain your remaining silver reserves. The League's recognition comes with strict limitations—you can facilitate trade but cannot store weapons or offer permanent residence to political refugees. Some of the Theban creditors remain unsatisfied, and you're forced to accept reduced profits to maintain the peace.\n\nOver the following season, as spring arrives, your emporion begins to function as intended. Merchants from across the Greek world stop to trade under Hermes' protection, and the steady flow of transaction fees slowly rebuilds your finances. Your reputation as the architect of this neutral ground spreads, though it also makes you more visible to those who would rather see you disappear. Still, the religious sanctuary provides genuine safety—even Athenian agents cannot openly move against you here.\n\nThe settlement grows modestly but steadily. Craftsmen set up workshops within the sacred boundaries, pilgrims leave offerings at the shrine, and your Swiss Army knife becomes legendary among the metalworkers who marvel at its impossible precision. Yet success brings new challenges. As your influence increases, so do expectations. Local communities look to you for arbitration in trade disputes. Neighboring poleis seek your counsel on commercial ventures.\n\nYour time machine's indicator pulses more frequently now, the light growing stronger each week. You've built something lasting, created relationships that anchor you to this time and place. But the device seems to sense your growing entanglement, responding to the depth of your commitment with increasing urgency.\n\nOne morning, Aristomenes brings troubling news. \"There's talk of war,\" he says grimly. \"Sparta masses troops, Athens recalls her fleets. When the fighting starts, even sacred ground may not protect us. We need to decide—do we prepare for siege, or find ways to profit from the coming conflict?\"\n\n[A] Transform the emporion into a neutral meeting ground where both sides can negotiate safely, positioning yourself as an essential mediator in the coming war.\n\n[B] Establish secret supply lines to provision whichever side offers better terms, using your geographical knowledge to create smuggling routes through supposedly impassable terrain.\n\n[C] Propose hosting the Hermaia festival—sacred games honoring your patron god—creating an annual tradition that would make your settlement too culturally important to attack even during wartime.\n\n<anchors>belonging[+15] legacy[+20] freedom[-8]</anchors>\n\nYour attempt to position the emporion as a neutral meeting ground begins promisingly when both Athenian and Spartan envoys agree to preliminary talks under Hermes' protection. The sacred boundaries seem to offer exactly the diplomatic sanctuary needed for delicate negotiations. But your luck sours catastrophically during the first major conference when a young Athenian diplomat—one of your former students, now grown to manhood—recognizes you despite your weathered appearance and changed circumstances.\n\n\"By the gods,\" Nikias whispers during a break in negotiations, \"you're the teacher who fled Athens. Xenios the supposed spy.\" Word spreads rapidly through both delegations. The Spartans, already suspicious of Athenian tricks, assume your presence proves the entire meeting is an elaborate trap. The Athenians, led by a hardline faction that remembers Pericles' concerns about your impossible knowledge, see confirmation of their worst fears about foreign infiltration.\n\nOver the following weeks, the diplomatic crisis spirals beyond your control. Both sides withdraw from negotiations, each blaming the other for harboring a known enemy agent. Your carefully built reputation as a neutral mediator crumbles overnight. Worse, the scandal reaches the Amphictyonic League, which begins reconsidering the emporion's sacred status. Several member cities question whether divine protection should extend to those who deceive the gods about their true nature.\n\nThe settlement itself begins to fracture under the pressure. Some merchants flee rather than face association with a suspected spy. Others, loyal to your years of successful partnership, stand by you but suffer as trade routes dry up. Aristomenes grows haggard trying to manage creditors who see the political chaos as excuse to call in debts immediately.\n\nYour time machine's indicator now pulses almost continuously, the light growing brighter with each passing day. The device seems to sense the collapse of everything you've built here, responding to your diminishing ties with increasing urgency to escape. Yet people still depend on you—craftsmen who invested their life savings, families who've made homes within the sacred boundaries, partnerships forged over months of shared hardship.\n\nStanding in the shrine at dawn, watching the morning light catch the bronze of Hermes' statue, you realize you've reached a crossroads that will define not just your survival, but who you choose to be.\n\n[A] Make a public confession of your true origins to both Athenian and Spartan representatives, gambling that the impossible truth might restore your credibility as a neutral party.\n\n[B] Secretly contact the Delphic Oracle and arrange for a \"divine revelation\" that vouches for your character, using your historical knowledge to craft prophecies that will seem authentically inspired.\n\n[C] Activate the time machine now, before the situation deteriorates further, abandoning the settlement and people who trusted you to preserve your own freedom.\n\n<anchors>belonging[+20] legacy[+25] freedom[-15]</anchors>\n\nYour clandestine journey to Delphi proves masterfully executed. Using your knowledge of the Oracle's operations—how the Pythia delivers prophecies, when the sacred vapors are strongest, which priests control access—you arrange a private consultation that appears entirely legitimate. Your carefully crafted \"divine revelations\" blend perfect historical accuracy with vague enough language to seem authentically oracular. You predict the exact timing of a Corinthian grain shortage, reference specific Spartan military movements that won't be public knowledge for weeks, and most convincingly, describe Athenian naval operations with impossible precision.\n\nThe Pythia, whether genuinely inspired or simply impressed by your uncanny accuracy, delivers a thunderous pronouncement that echoes throughout the Greek world: \"The stranger called Xenios serves truth itself. He who questions his neutrality questions the gods' wisdom. Let all who seek honest commerce find sanctuary in his sacred ground.\" The Oracle's validation carries such weight that even your former accusers must publicly accept it or risk appearing impious.\n\nOver the following months, as autumn deepens into winter, your vindication transforms from religious pronouncement into political reality. The same Athenian diplomat who recognized you now speaks grudgingly of divine intervention. Spartan representatives, deeply reverent of oracular pronouncements, begin treating you with newfound respect. The Amphictyonic League not only reaffirms your emporion's sacred status but grants expanded privileges, allowing you to host official diplomatic meetings under Apollo's protection as well as Hermes'.\n\nTrade returns in force as confidence rebuilds. Your settlement becomes the premier neutral ground for inter-polis negotiations, with permanent ambassadors from major cities establishing residences within the sacred boundaries. The fees from diplomatic services, combined with renewed commercial activity, make you wealthier than your teaching days in Athens ever did. More importantly, you've created something unprecedented—a truly neutral space in a world increasingly divided by the approaching war.\n\nYour time machine's pulsing has grown urgent, the light now bright enough to see even in daylight. The device seems to recognize that you've reached a pinnacle of achievement here, your influence spreading throughout the Greek world. Yet this success has also created the deepest bonds you've ever formed—not just business partnerships, but genuine friendships forged through shared crisis and triumph.\n\nAs you stand in the expanded shrine, now adorned with offerings from across Greece, Aristomenes approaches with news that crystallizes the moment of choice: \"The Great War has begun in earnest. Athens and Sparta both request our services as the primary neutral ground for prisoner exchanges and peace negotiations. We'll be at the center of history itself.\"\n\n[A] Accept the role as the war's primary neutral mediator, knowing your historical knowledge could help end the conflict years early and save countless lives.\n\n[B] Gradually withdraw from active mediation while maintaining the emporion's neutral status, focusing on preserving what you've built rather than risking it in the larger conflict.\n\n[C] Use your influence to quietly evacuate non-combatants from cities you know will face siege, establishing refugee camps under religious protection without revealing how you know which places will fall.\n\n<anchors>belonging[+25] legacy[+30] freedom[-20]</anchors>\n\nYour decision to step back from active mediation while maintaining the emporion's neutrality proves wise and sustainable. You delegate the most sensitive diplomatic meetings to trusted associates while remaining available for consultation, creating a buffer between yourself and the war's most dangerous political currents. The arrangement works smoothly—both sides respect your sacred ground while you avoid the impossible position of trying to broker peace between powers destined for decades of conflict.\n\nOver the following seasons, your careful withdrawal allows the settlement to flourish in ways direct involvement might have prevented. Free from the pressure of constant high-stakes negotiations, you focus on developing the emporion's infrastructure and community. New workshops spring up within the sacred boundaries, a small but excellent school attracts students from across Greece, and your trading network expands to include routes reaching as far as the Black Sea colonies.\n\nThe war rages around your neutral sanctuary, but your measured approach keeps the settlement prosperous and safe. You facilitate prisoner exchanges and occasional truces without claiming credit for grand diplomacy. Your former students, now grown to positions of influence in various cities, quietly send their own children to study at your school. The fees from diplomatic services remain steady, while expanded trade brings wealth without the constant threat of political miscalculation.\n\nYet as winter approaches, marking nearly a full year since the war began, you face an unexpected challenge. Your success in remaining neutral has attracted attention from those who profit from prolonged conflict. A group of arms dealers and mercenary captains, led by a scarred Corinthian named Kleander, approaches with a proposition that's barely disguised as a threat.\n\n\"Neutrality is profitable,\" Kleander says, examining the shrine's expensive offerings with calculating eyes. \"But imagine how much more profitable the right kind of... selective neutrality could be. Certain information about enemy movements, strategic delays in prisoner exchanges, temporary equipment storage for the highest bidder.\"\n\nYour time machine pulses steadily now, its light so bright that you sometimes notice it even through your sleeve during daylight hours. The window hasn't opened yet, but something fundamental is shifting. The device seems to sense that your current stability, however comfortable, may not last indefinitely.\n\n[A] Firmly reject their proposition and strengthen your defenses, relying on religious sanctuary and allied merchants to protect your genuine neutrality.\n\n[B] Pretend to consider their offer while secretly gathering information about their network to expose them to the proper authorities in multiple cities.\n\n[C] Invoke the ancient tradition of the Sacred Truce by declaring a permanent hieros topos around your settlement, seeking recognition from the Olympic authorities that would make any violation a crime against all Greeks.\n\n<anchors>belonging[+15] legacy[+20] freedom[-10]</anchors>\n\n[The time machine window opens]\nThe device against your wrist grows warm—not uncomfortably so, but with the unmistakable pulse you've learned to recognize. As Kleander continues outlining his corrupt proposition, you feel the familiar thrum against your skin, see the faint glow even through your sleeve. The small display shows the date clearly: -431, Classical Athens. The window is open.\n\nYour mind races as the Corinthian talks. Around you stands everything you've built—the bustling workshops where craftsmen create beauty that will outlast empires, the school where young minds wrestle with ideas that will shape philosophy for millennia, the shrine where honest merchants find sanctuary from a world gone mad with war. Aristomenes catches your eye from across the courtyard, concern creasing his weathered face as he watches this unwelcome delegation. Students pause in their exercises, sensing tension. The cook who makes your favorite barley cakes each morning hurries past with nervous glances.\n\nThese people don't just know you—they depend on you. The settlement exists because of your vision, your impossible knowledge, your patient years of building trust stone by stone. If you vanish now, what becomes of the neutral ground that's saved so many lives? Of the diplomatic traditions you've established? Of the young scholars who look to you not just as teacher, but as the architect of something unprecedented in Greek history?\n\nBut the device pulses with promise too—of mysteries unsolved, of eras unexplored, of the possibility that somewhere in time's vast reach, you might find your way home to that garage in Palo Alto where this all began. You've tasted one life fully. How many others await?\n\nKleander is still talking, his scarred hands gesturing at your prosperity. He has no idea he's interrupted the most important moment of your existence. The choice burns against your wrist, warm and patient and inexorable.\n\n[A] Handle Kleander's threat while protecting everything you've built, using your network of allies and accumulated influence to preserve the emporion's sacred neutrality.\n\n[B] Activate the time machine and leave this era behind, abandoning the settlement and people who trusted you but preserving your freedom to continue the journey.\n\n[C] This is my home now. I choose to stay here forever, dedicating the rest of my life to protecting what we've built together.\n\n<anchors>belonging[+35] legacy[+40] freedom[+25]</anchors>\n\n[You choose to stay forever]\nYou feel the device's warmth fade against your wrist as the decision crystallizes in your heart. The pulsing slows, dims, and finally dies—not with mechanical failure, but with the quiet finality of a door closing on one path so another may be walked fully. When you roll up your sleeve later that night, the display shows nothing but dark metal. The window has closed forever, and you are no longer a traveler between worlds but simply a man who has chosen his home.\n\nThe years that follow prove your choice wise beyond measure. Kleander's corruption scheme crumbles when you expose his network to authorities across Greece, strengthening your reputation as an incorruptible neutral arbiter. Your emporion becomes legendary—the Sacred Grove of Hermes where honest trade flourishes even as the Peloponnesian War tears the Greek world apart. Students come from as far as Sicily to study in your school, where they learn not just rhetoric and mathematics, but the radical idea that enemies can meet in peace. Aristomenes becomes more than a partner; he's the brother you chose, standing beside you through plague years and bitter winters, celebrating when former students return as ambassadors and philosophers. You never marry—some whisper it's because you loved a woman from a distant land—but you mentor dozens of young people who call you father in all but blood. Your Swiss Army knife becomes the stuff of legend among metalworkers, studied and copied though never equaled.\n\nAs decades pass and your hair turns white, the emporion evolves into something beyond your original vision. It's not just a trading post but a cultural bridge, where Persian scholars debate with Athenian philosophers, where Spartan warriors lay down arms to study poetry, where the first seeds of cosmopolitan Greek culture take root. You live to see Alexander march past your borders, carrying ideas that first flowered in your neutral ground to the edges of the known world. Former students become the diplomats who shape the Hellenistic age, carrying forward the principle that enemies need not remain enemies forever.\n\nOn your final morning, sitting in the shrine you built to a god of travelers, you feel no regret for the journey not taken. The time machine lies buried beneath the altar's foundation—you interred it there decades ago, knowing its purpose was complete. Around you, grandchildren of your first students play in gardens planted by Persian and Athenian hands alike. You built something that outlasted empires: proof that a stranger can become family, that neutrality is not indifference but love made practical, that home is not where you begin but where you choose to belong. The Far-Seer found his farthest shore in the place he finally chose to stay.\n\n<anchors>belonging[+0] legacy[+0] freedom[+0]</anchors>"

      "The world lurches sideways and your stomach drops as if you've fallen off a cliff. One moment you were in your garage in Palo Alto, the next you're stumbling onto sun-baked stone, ears ringing from the transition. The acrid smell of olive oil, sweat, and something else—human waste?—hits you like a wall. Your jeans and t-shirt feel absurdly out of place as sandaled feet shuffle past, their owners draped in rough wool and linen.\n\nYou're in some kind of marketplace. Men in short tunics argue over clay amphorae while women peer from beneath veils. The Greek you studied in college comes flooding back as you catch fragments: \"...silver from Laurion...\" \"...ships from Egypt...\" A few people stare at your strange clothes, whispering. One bearded man points and says something about \"barbarian cloth.\"\n\nYour heart hammers as you realize how exposed you are. These people have never seen denim, never seen a printed t-shirt. A small crowd begins to gather, their voices rising. Someone mentions taking you to the archons—the magistrates. You catch the word \"spy\" and \"Persian.\" The second Persian War only ended a generation ago. Being mistaken for an enemy could be fatal.\n\nA muscular man with calloused hands steps closer, speaking slowly as if to a child: \"Who are you, stranger? What polis do you serve?\" The crowd presses in, waiting for your answer. You need to respond quickly before this escalates.\n\n[A] Claim to be a traveling merchant from a distant land beyond their knowledge, hoping your strange goods will seem valuable rather than suspicious.\n\n[B] Pretend to be a shipwrecked survivor who has lost everything, appealing to Greek hospitality customs toward suppliants.\n\n[C] Present yourself as a philosopher seeking wisdom, knowing that Athens respects intellectual visitors and foreign teachers.\n\n<anchors>belonging[0] legacy[0] freedom[0]</anchors>",
      "You drop to your knees on the rough stone, arms outstretched in the formal posture of a suppliant. \"I throw myself upon your mercy,\" you cry out in halting Greek. \"My ship foundered in a storm—everything lost to Poseidon's fury. I am Xenios, cast upon your shores with nothing but my life.\"\n\nThe crowd's mood shifts instantly. Several men step back, making the sign against evil. In Greek culture, suppliants are sacred—to harm one risks the gods' wrath. The muscular man who questioned you now looks troubled rather than suspicious. \"Stranger, if you truly seek Zeus Xenios's protection...\" He glances at the others, then nods slowly. \"I am Kleomenes, potter of the Kerameikos. My wife will not forgive me if I turn away one blessed by the god of hospitality.\"\n\nOver the following weeks, your gambit pays off beyond your wildest hopes. Kleomenes and his family take you in, providing food, shelter, and rough clothing that helps you blend in. His wife Penthesilea treats you kindly but keeps her distance—proper for a woman with a strange man in the house. Their teenage son Nikias becomes fascinated by your odd accent and occasional slips into concepts that don't exist yet. You learn the rhythm of Athenian life: the agora's bustle, the workshops' hammer-song, the evening symposiums where men recline and debate philosophy over wine.\n\nBut as the season turns toward autumn, questions multiply. Other potters ask about your family, your polis, your training. Your story of shipwreck explains your lack of possessions, but not your ignorance of basic pottery techniques or your strange knowledge of distant places. When you accidentally mention concepts like \"democracy in the future\" or reference events that haven't happened yet, people exchange worried glances.\n\nOne evening, Kleomenes pulls you aside. \"Friend Xenios, there are whispers. Some say you speak like an oracle—knowing things you shouldn't know. Others wonder if you're a Persian spy with an elaborate story. I believe in your shipwreck, but you must establish yourself properly in Athens, or suspicion will grow dangerous.\"\n\n[A] Seek work in the silver mines at Laurion, where desperate men ask few questions and your strange knowledge might help you survive the brutal conditions.\n\n[B] Offer your services to the city as a foreign teacher, following the tradition of wise men like Anaxagoras who came from abroad to educate Athenian youth.\n\n[C] Approach the temple of Hephaestus near the Agora, claiming the god of craftsmanship sent you visions in dreams—explaining your odd knowledge while gaining religious protection.\n\n<anchors>belonging[+5] legacy[0] freedom[-3]</anchors>",
      "Your decision to present yourself as a teacher proves inspired. Kleomenes introduces you to Hipponikos, a wealthy citizen whose son needs tutoring in mathematics and natural philosophy. When you demonstrate your knowledge—casually explaining geometric principles that won't be \"discovered\" for decades and discussing the movements of celestial bodies with startling precision—Hipponikos's eyes widen with genuine amazement.\n\n\"By the gods,\" he whispers after you predict a lunar eclipse to the day. \"You truly are touched by divine wisdom.\" Word spreads quickly through Athens's elite circles. The foreign teacher who knows impossible things becomes the season's fascination. Wealthy families compete to hire you, and your rates climb steadily.\n\nOver the following weeks, your reputation solidifies. You're careful to frame your knowledge as \"dreams from Apollo\" or \"visions granted by Athena,\" which satisfies Greek curiosity about your impossible insights. Your students include the sons of prominent citizens—young men who will shape Athens's future. When you subtly introduce concepts of hygiene to prevent disease, or demonstrate principles of engineering that could improve their siege engines, they hang on every word.\n\nThe money flows freely now. You've moved into your own modest house near the Agora, with a slave named Thrax to manage household duties. Your success, however, draws unexpected attention. As winter approaches, a messenger arrives with an invitation that makes your blood run cold: Pericles himself requests your presence. The most powerful man in Athens has heard of the foreign teacher with impossible knowledge.\n\n\"The strategos wishes to discuss philosophy,\" the messenger explains. \"He's particularly interested in your... unique perspectives on statecraft and the future of Athens.\" But there's something in his tone that suggests this isn't merely social curiosity. Pericles is brilliant, suspicious, and utterly ruthless with threats to Athenian power.\n\n[A] Accept the invitation immediately, bringing gifts and demonstrating complete deference to avoid seeming like a threat to his authority.\n\n[B] Request a delay to properly prepare, using the time to research Pericles' current political challenges so you can offer genuinely useful advice.\n\n[C] Approach Aspasia first—as Pericles' foreign-born partner, she understands the delicate position of influential outsiders and might provide crucial guidance.\n\n<anchors>belonging[+8] legacy[+12] freedom[-5]</anchors>",
      "Your attempt to reach Aspasia proves more complicated than expected. As a foreign woman, even one of her stature, she doesn't move freely through Athens like a citizen male. Your first inquiries at symposiums are met with raised eyebrows—respectable men don't discuss seeking private audience with another man's hetaira, even one as intellectually renowned as Aspasia.\n\nWhen you finally make contact through a chain of intermediaries, the meeting itself becomes problematic. Aspasia agrees to see you, but only in the presence of other women at a religious festival honoring Demeter. The conversation must be carefully coded, speaking in metaphors about \"navigating storms\" and \"foreign seeds taking root in Attic soil.\" She's brilliant and immediately grasps your situation, but warns that your approach has already created gossip.\n\n\"Pericles has heard you sought me out before answering his summons,\" she says quietly, pretending to examine votive offerings. \"He sees this as either clever—understanding the value of counsel—or suspicious—foreign conspirators conferring in secret.\" Her dark eyes meet yours briefly. \"Your reputation for impossible knowledge already troubles him. Some whisper you're a Persian mystic sent to bewitch Athenian minds.\"\n\nOver the following weeks, the delay costs you. While you waited for the meeting with Aspasia, then processed her advice, Pericles' invitation has transformed into something more formal and less friendly. The summons now comes through official channels, couched in language that suggests investigation rather than philosophical discourse. Your students' families begin expressing quiet concerns. The wealthy Hipponikos mentions that \"certain citizens\" have questioned your loyalty to Athens.\n\nYet Aspasia's counsel proves invaluable. She's given you crucial intelligence: Pericles fears that Sparta is infiltrating Athens with foreign agents posing as teachers and philosophers. Your timing couldn't be worse—or perhaps more revealing of your true nature.\n\n[A] Present yourself to Pericles with complete honesty about your origins, gambling that the impossible truth might be more believable than any lie.\n\n[B] Offer to prove your loyalty by providing intelligence about Spartan military tactics, using your historical knowledge to give Athens genuine strategic advantages.\n\n[C] Propose hosting a public demonstration of your teaching methods in the Theater of Dionysus, letting all citizens witness your wisdom and judge your character openly—following the Athenian tradition of deciding important matters through public scrutiny.\n\n<anchors>belonging[+3] legacy[+5] freedom[-8]</anchors>",
      "Your meeting with Pericles in his private study begins promisingly. When you offer detailed knowledge of Spartan military formations—describing their phalanx tactics, the organization of their army by age groups, and weaknesses in their siege capabilities—his sharp eyes gleam with interest. But your luck sours when you reveal too much too quickly.\n\n\"Fascinating,\" Pericles says, leaning forward. \"Tell me, how does a shipwrecked teacher know that Sparta trains their warriors in groups of thirty-five, when our own spies report conflicting numbers?\" His voice grows dangerously quiet. \"And how do you know about their new iron-working techniques from the Messenian helots? That intelligence only reached us three days ago through... very specific channels.\"\n\nThe trap snaps shut around you. Your historical knowledge, meant to prove loyalty, instead reveals impossible accuracy about current military secrets. Pericles summons two guards, and suddenly you're not a honored guest but a suspected spy under house arrest. Over the following weeks, as winter deepens, investigators comb through your life in Athens. They question your students, examine your teaching methods, and press Kleomenes about your early days in the city.\n\nThe accusations multiply beyond your control. Someone claims they saw you making strange marks—your occasional notes in English alphabet. Another swears you predicted a grain shipment's arrival date with suspicious precision. Your former patron Hipponikos, fearing association with a traitor, publicly distances himself. Students' families cancel their contracts. The comfortable life you built crumbles as Athens' paranoia focuses on you.\n\nYet you're not entirely powerless. Your house arrest is loose—more surveillance than imprisonment—and you still have allies. Thrax, your household slave, remains loyal and serves as messenger. Some of your former students quietly express doubt about the charges. Aspasia, through careful intermediaries, hints that not everyone in Pericles' circle believes you're a threat.\n\n[A] Attempt to escape Athens entirely, using your knowledge of the countryside and historical events to evade pursuit and seek refuge in a neutral polis.\n\n[B] Demand trial by jury in the Athenian courts, trusting that your reputation as a teacher and the weakness of evidence might sway the democratic assembly.\n\n[C] Offer to submit to the sacred test of the Delphic Oracle, proposing that Apollo himself judge your innocence—a gambit that would either vindicate you completely or destroy you utterly.\n\n<anchors>belonging[-5] legacy[-3] freedom[-10]</anchors>",
      "Your escape from Athens begins well enough. Thrax helps you slip away during a religious procession when your watchers are distracted, and your knowledge of ancient geography serves you initially. You know which mountain passes lead to neutral territories, which roads the Athenians patrol most heavily. But your luck falters when winter storms strike earlier than expected, turning familiar paths into treacherous mud and forcing you to take shelter in villages where strangers draw unwanted attention.\n\nThe delay proves costly. In a small farming settlement near Megara, your accent and inability to explain your presence convincingly raises suspicions. The village headman, loyal to Athens and eager to curry favor, sends word of the suspicious foreigner matching the description of Pericles' escaped prisoner. By the time you realize your mistake and flee, Athenian cavalry are already riding hard along the coastal roads.\n\nOver the following weeks, you're reduced to hiding in caves and olive groves, scavenging what food you can. Your modern clothes, long since replaced by Greek garb, can't protect you from the mountain cold. The Swiss Army knife proves invaluable for survival tasks, but you're always one step ahead of pursuit. Twice you barely avoid Athenian search parties by hiding in sacred groves where soldiers won't enter after dark.\n\nAs spring arrives, your situation grows desperate rather than better. You're branded an outlaw throughout Attica, cut off from civilized shelter. Wild animals and bandits pose constant threats in the remote areas where you're forced to hide. Your smartphone's battery, even with the solar charger, runs dangerously low from overuse of the compass function during nighttime navigation.\n\nBut opportunity comes from an unexpected source. While foraging near the border with Boeotia, you encounter a group of Theban merchants whose cart has broken down. Their leader, Aristomenes, eyes you warily but seems more interested in your obvious desperation than any bounty on your head.\n\n\"You have the look of a man with nothing left to lose,\" he observes. \"Such men can be useful, if they're willing to work for honest silver rather than steal it.\"\n\n[A] Offer your services as a guide and translator for their trading expeditions, using your geographical knowledge to help them find profitable new routes.\n\n[B] Propose to teach their children and household slaves to read and write, establishing yourself as a valuable asset worth protecting from Athenian pursuit.\n\n[C] Suggest they hire you to help negotiate with the Oracle at Delphi on their behalf, knowing that your \"divine visions\" could provide the merchants with seemingly prophetic guidance for their business ventures.\n\n<anchors>belonging[-8] legacy[-5] freedom[+12]</anchors>",
      "Your gambit with Aristomenes pays off spectacularly. When you guide his caravan to a previously unknown river crossing that saves them three days of travel, then help them avoid bandits by suggesting an alternate route through sacred groves, the Theban merchant becomes convinced you're blessed by Hermes, god of travelers and trade. Your knowledge of ancient geography—where settlements will grow, which mountain passes stay clear longest—seems like divine inspiration to men who navigate by landmarks and local reputation.\n\nWithin weeks, you've become invaluable to his trading network. You lead them to deposits of high-quality clay that potters will prize, guide them to fishing villages with abundant catches perfect for inland markets, and most lucratively, direct them to communities with surplus grain just as other cities face shortages. Your smartphone's offline maps, carefully consulted in private, reveal mineral deposits and geographic features that won't be discovered for centuries.\n\nOver the following months, as spring turns to summer, your reputation spreads through Boeotian merchant circles. You're known as \"Xenios the Far-Seer,\" the foreign guide whose routes never fail. The silver flows freely—enough to buy proper clothes, weapons, and your own pack animals. More importantly, you've earned protection. When Athenian agents inquire about a fugitive teacher, Theban merchants claim they've never heard of such a man. They only know a valuable trading partner who brings them profit.\n\nThe work suits you in ways you hadn't expected. Days on mountain trails, nights around campfires sharing stories with hardened traders, the satisfaction of successful negotiations in foreign markets—it's a life of constant movement and challenge. Yet as autumn approaches, Aristomenes makes an offer that could change everything.\n\n\"The Pythian Games approach at Delphi,\" he says over evening wine. \"All the great merchants will gather, along with representatives from every polis. It's dangerous for you—Athens will have agents there—but also an opportunity. If you could guide our expedition to victory in the trade competitions, we'd all be rich beyond measure.\"\n\n[A] Accept the challenge and travel to Delphi, using your knowledge of historical events to help the merchants succeed at the games despite the risk of Athenian discovery.\n\n[B] Propose establishing a permanent trading post in a remote but strategically located valley, creating a safe base of operations while building something lasting.\n\n[C] Suggest forming an alliance with the Delphic priests by offering to interpret \"divine signs\" for pilgrims, knowing that religious sanctuary could protect you from political enemies while legitimizing your prophetic abilities.\n\n<anchors>belonging[+12] legacy[+8] freedom[+3]</anchors>",
      "Your proposal to establish a permanent trading post excites Aristomenes and his partners. You identify a perfect valley—defensible, with fresh water and natural shelter, positioned along a route that will become crucial in future conflicts. The merchants pool their silver to purchase the land from local farmers, and construction begins with high hopes. Your knowledge of engineering principles helps design storage facilities and defensive walls that impress even experienced builders.\n\nBut the venture quickly encounters problems you couldn't foresee. The local Boeotian council, initially welcoming, grows suspicious when they realize how strategically valuable your chosen location truly is. They demand additional tribute payments and impose restrictions on which goods can be stored there. Worse, the farmers you displaced prove more troublesome than expected—several have relatives in positions of minor authority who begin questioning why foreigners should control such prime territory.\n\nOver the following weeks, as winter sets in, the complications multiply. A harsh early freeze destroys much of the construction work, splitting timber and cracking newly-laid stone foundations. The costs spiral beyond the merchants' initial investment, forcing them to take on debt with Theban moneylenders at ruinous interest rates. Some of your trading partners begin grumbling that the \"Far-Seer's\" vision has led them into a costly trap.\n\nMost dangerously, the attention drawn by your ambitious project reaches unwelcome ears. A Spartan envoy, traveling through Boeotia on diplomatic business, takes particular interest in your fortified trading post so close to Attica's border. He asks pointed questions about the foreign architect who designed such sophisticated defenses. Meanwhile, Athenian merchants visiting Theban markets hear rumors of a mysterious trader whose geographical knowledge seems impossibly precise.\n\nYour time machine indicator, dark for months, suddenly pulses with faint light as you examine the half-built walls in the morning frost. The window isn't open yet, but something has changed. The device seems to respond to moments of transition, of choices that define who you become.\n\nAristomenes approaches with grim news. \"The Spartans are asking too many questions,\" he says quietly. \"And our Theban creditors grow impatient. We need a solution, friend, before this venture ruins us all.\"\n\n[A] Cut your losses and dissolve the partnership, distributing what assets remain and scattering to different cities before the political heat intensifies.\n\n[B] Double down by recruiting skilled craftsmen and former soldiers to turn the trading post into a proper fortress-town, creating something too valuable for any power to destroy.\n\n[C] Invoke the ancient Greek tradition of establishing an emporion—a neutral trading sanctuary under divine protection—by dedicating the post to Hermes and seeking recognition from the Amphictyonic League.\n\n<anchors>belonging[+8] legacy[+15] freedom[-12]</anchors>",
      "Your gambit to invoke divine protection proves moderately successful. The formal dedication to Hermes provides exactly the political cover you hoped for—neither Sparta nor Athens can openly threaten a sanctified trading post without risking the gods' wrath. The Amphictyonic League, after lengthy deliberation and generous offerings, grants limited recognition to your emporion. The sacred boundaries are marked with stone herms, and a small shrine to Hermes Agoraios rises at the settlement's heart.\n\nHowever, the process consumes months of negotiations and nearly bankrupts your merchant partners. The required offerings, ceremonial feasts, and bribes to various officials drain your remaining silver reserves. The League's recognition comes with strict limitations—you can facilitate trade but cannot store weapons or offer permanent residence to political refugees. Some of the Theban creditors remain unsatisfied, and you're forced to accept reduced profits to maintain the peace.\n\nOver the following season, as spring arrives, your emporion begins to function as intended. Merchants from across the Greek world stop to trade under Hermes' protection, and the steady flow of transaction fees slowly rebuilds your finances. Your reputation as the architect of this neutral ground spreads, though it also makes you more visible to those who would rather see you disappear. Still, the religious sanctuary provides genuine safety—even Athenian agents cannot openly move against you here.\n\nThe settlement grows modestly but steadily. Craftsmen set up workshops within the sacred boundaries, pilgrims leave offerings at the shrine, and your Swiss Army knife becomes legendary among the metalworkers who marvel at its impossible precision. Yet success brings new challenges. As your influence increases, so do expectations. Local communities look to you for arbitration in trade disputes. Neighboring poleis seek your counsel on commercial ventures.\n\nYour time machine's indicator pulses more frequently now, the light growing stronger each week. You've built something lasting, created relationships that anchor you to this time and place. But the device seems to sense your growing entanglement, responding to the depth of your commitment with increasing urgency.\n\nOne morning, Aristomenes brings troubling news. \"There's talk of war,\" he says grimly. \"Sparta masses troops, Athens recalls her fleets. When the fighting starts, even sacred ground may not protect us. We need to decide—do we prepare for siege, or find ways to profit from the coming conflict?\"\n\n[A] Transform the emporion into a neutral meeting ground where both sides can negotiate safely, positioning yourself as an essential mediator in the coming war.\n\n[B] Establish secret supply lines to provision whichever side offers better terms, using your geographical knowledge to create smuggling routes through supposedly impassable terrain.\n\n[C] Propose hosting the Hermaia festival—sacred games honoring your patron god—creating an annual tradition that would make your settlement too culturally important to attack even during wartime.\n\n<anchors>belonging[+15] legacy[+20] freedom[-8]</anchors>",
      "Your attempt to position the emporion as a neutral meeting ground begins promisingly when both Athenian and Spartan envoys agree to preliminary talks under Hermes' protection. The sacred boundaries seem to offer exactly the diplomatic sanctuary needed for delicate negotiations. But your luck sours catastrophically during the first major conference when a young Athenian diplomat—one of your former students, now grown to manhood—recognizes you despite your weathered appearance and changed circumstances.\n\n\"By the gods,\" Nikias whispers during a break in negotiations, \"you're the teacher who fled Athens. Xenios the supposed spy.\" Word spreads rapidly through both delegations. The Spartans, already suspicious of Athenian tricks, assume your presence proves the entire meeting is an elaborate trap. The Athenians, led by a hardline faction that remembers Pericles' concerns about your impossible knowledge, see confirmation of their worst fears about foreign infiltration.\n\nOver the following weeks, the diplomatic crisis spirals beyond your control. Both sides withdraw from negotiations, each blaming the other for harboring a known enemy agent. Your carefully built reputation as a neutral mediator crumbles overnight. Worse, the scandal reaches the Amphictyonic League, which begins reconsidering the emporion's sacred status. Several member cities question whether divine protection should extend to those who deceive the gods about their true nature.\n\nThe settlement itself begins to fracture under the pressure. Some merchants flee rather than face association with a suspected spy. Others, loyal to your years of successful partnership, stand by you but suffer as trade routes dry up. Aristomenes grows haggard trying to manage creditors who see the political chaos as excuse to call in debts immediately.\n\nYour time machine's indicator now pulses almost continuously, the light growing brighter with each passing day. The device seems to sense the collapse of everything you've built here, responding to your diminishing ties with increasing urgency to escape. Yet people still depend on you—craftsmen who invested their life savings, families who've made homes within the sacred boundaries, partnerships forged over months of shared hardship.\n\nStanding in the shrine at dawn, watching the morning light catch the bronze of Hermes' statue, you realize you've reached a crossroads that will define not just your survival, but who you choose to be.\n\n[A] Make a public confession of your true origins to both Athenian and Spartan representatives, gambling that the impossible truth might restore your credibility as a neutral party.\n\n[B] Secretly contact the Delphic Oracle and arrange for a \"divine revelation\" that vouches for your character, using your historical knowledge to craft prophecies that will seem authentically inspired.\n\n[C] Activate the time machine now, before the situation deteriorates further, abandoning the settlement and people who trusted you to preserve your own freedom.\n\n<anchors>belonging[+20] legacy[+25] freedom[-15]</anchors>",
      "Your clandestine journey to Delphi proves masterfully executed. Using your knowledge of the Oracle's operations—how the Pythia delivers prophecies, when the sacred vapors are strongest, which priests control access—you arrange a private consultation that appears entirely legitimate. Your carefully crafted \"divine revelations\" blend perfect historical accuracy with vague enough language to seem authentically oracular. You predict the exact timing of a Corinthian grain shortage, reference specific Spartan military movements that won't be public knowledge for weeks, and most convincingly, describe Athenian naval operations with impossible precision.\n\nThe Pythia, whether genuinely inspired or simply impressed by your uncanny accuracy, delivers a thunderous pronouncement that echoes throughout the Greek world: \"The stranger called Xenios serves truth itself. He who questions his neutrality questions the gods' wisdom. Let all who seek honest commerce find sanctuary in his sacred ground.\" The Oracle's validation carries such weight that even your former accusers must publicly accept it or risk appearing impious.\n\nOver the following months, as autumn deepens into winter, your vindication transforms from religious pronouncement into political reality. The same Athenian diplomat who recognized you now speaks grudgingly of divine intervention. Spartan representatives, deeply reverent of oracular pronouncements, begin treating you with newfound respect. The Amphictyonic League not only reaffirms your emporion's sacred status but grants expanded privileges, allowing you to host official diplomatic meetings under Apollo's protection as well as Hermes'.\n\nTrade returns in force as confidence rebuilds. Your settlement becomes the premier neutral ground for inter-polis negotiations, with permanent ambassadors from major cities establishing residences within the sacred boundaries. The fees from diplomatic services, combined with renewed commercial activity, make you wealthier than your teaching days in Athens ever did. More importantly, you've created something unprecedented—a truly neutral space in a world increasingly divided by the approaching war.\n\nYour time machine's pulsing has grown urgent, the light now bright enough to see even in daylight. The device seems to recognize that you've reached a pinnacle of achievement here, your influence spreading throughout the Greek world. Yet this success has also created the deepest bonds you've ever formed—not just business partnerships, but genuine friendships forged through shared crisis and triumph.\n\nAs you stand in the expanded shrine, now adorned with offerings from across Greece, Aristomenes approaches with news that crystallizes the moment of choice: \"The Great War has begun in earnest. Athens and Sparta both request our services as the primary neutral ground for prisoner exchanges and peace negotiations. We'll be at the center of history itself.\"\n\n[A] Accept the role as the war's primary neutral mediator, knowing your historical knowledge could help end the conflict years early and save countless lives.\n\n[B] Gradually withdraw from active mediation while maintaining the emporion's neutral status, focusing on preserving what you've built rather than risking it in the larger conflict.\n\n[C] Use your influence to quietly evacuate non-combatants from cities you know will face siege, establishing refugee camps under religious protection without revealing how you know which places will fall.\n\n<anchors>belonging[+25] legacy[+30] freedom[-20]</anchors>",
      "Your decision to step back from active mediation while maintaining the emporion's neutrality proves wise and sustainable. You delegate the most sensitive diplomatic meetings to trusted associates while remaining available for consultation, creating a buffer between yourself and the war's most dangerous political currents. The arrangement works smoothly—both sides respect your sacred ground while you avoid the impossible position of trying to broker peace between powers destined for decades of conflict.\n\nOver the following seasons, your careful withdrawal allows the settlement to flourish in ways direct involvement might have prevented. Free from the pressure of constant high-stakes negotiations, you focus on developing the emporion's infrastructure and community. New workshops spring up within the sacred boundaries, a small but excellent school attracts students from across Greece, and your trading network expands to include routes reaching as far as the Black Sea colonies.\n\nThe war rages around your neutral sanctuary, but your measured approach keeps the settlement prosperous and safe. You facilitate prisoner exchanges and occasional truces without claiming credit for grand diplomacy. Your former students, now grown to positions of influence in various cities, quietly send their own children to study at your school. The fees from diplomatic services remain steady, while expanded trade brings wealth without the constant threat of political miscalculation.\n\nYet as winter approaches, marking nearly a full year since the war began, you face an unexpected challenge. Your success in remaining neutral has attracted attention from those who profit from prolonged conflict. A group of arms dealers and mercenary captains, led by a scarred Corinthian named Kleander, approaches with a proposition that's barely disguised as a threat.\n\n\"Neutrality is profitable,\" Kleander says, examining the shrine's expensive offerings with calculating eyes. \"But imagine how much more profitable the right kind of... selective neutrality could be. Certain information about enemy movements, strategic delays in prisoner exchanges, temporary equipment storage for the highest bidder.\"\n\nYour time machine pulses steadily now, its light so bright that you sometimes notice it even through your sleeve during daylight hours. The window hasn't opened yet, but something fundamental is shifting. The device seems to sense that your current stability, however comfortable, may not last indefinitely.\n\n[A] Firmly reject their proposition and strengthen your defenses, relying on religious sanctuary and allied merchants to protect your genuine neutrality.\n\n[B] Pretend to consider their offer while secretly gathering information about their network to expose them to the proper authorities in multiple cities.\n\n[C] Invoke the ancient tradition of the Sacred Truce by declaring a permanent hieros topos around your settlement, seeking recognition from the Olympic authorities that would make any violation a crime against all Greeks.\n\n<anchors>belonging[+15] legacy[+20] freedom[-10]</anchors>",
      "[The time machine window opens]\nThe device against your wrist grows warm—not uncomfortably so, but with the unmistakable pulse you've learned to recognize. As Kleander continues outlining his corrupt proposition, you feel the familiar thrum against your skin, see the faint glow even through your sleeve. The small display shows the date clearly: -431, Classical Athens. The window is open.\n\nYour mind races as the Corinthian talks. Around you stands everything you've built—the bustling workshops where craftsmen create beauty that will outlast empires, the school where young minds wrestle with ideas that will shape philosophy for millennia, the shrine where honest merchants find sanctuary from a world gone mad with war. Aristomenes catches your eye from across the courtyard, concern creasing his weathered face as he watches this unwelcome delegation. Students pause in their exercises, sensing tension. The cook who makes your favorite barley cakes each morning hurries past with nervous glances.\n\nThese people don't just know you—they depend on you. The settlement exists because of your vision, your impossible knowledge, your patient years of building trust stone by stone. If you vanish now, what becomes of the neutral ground that's saved so many lives? Of the diplomatic traditions you've established? Of the young scholars who look to you not just as teacher, but as the architect of something unprecedented in Greek history?\n\nBut the device pulses with promise too—of mysteries unsolved, of eras unexplored, of the possibility that somewhere in time's vast reach, you might find your way home to that garage in Palo Alto where this all began. You've tasted one life fully. How many others await?\n\nKleander is still talking, his scarred hands gesturing at your prosperity. He has no idea he's interrupted the most important moment of your existence. The choice burns against your wrist, warm and patient and inexorable.\n\n[A] Handle Kleander's threat while protecting everything you've built, using your network of allies and accumulated influence to preserve the emporion's sacred neutrality.\n\n[B] Activate the time machine and leave this era behind, abandoning the settlement and people who trusted you but preserving your freedom to continue the journey.\n\n[C] This is my home now. I choose to stay here forever, dedicating the rest of my life to protecting what we've built together.\n\n<anchors>belonging[+35] legacy[+40] freedom[+25]</anchors>",
      "[You choose to stay forever]\nYou feel the device's warmth fade against your wrist as the decision crystallizes in your heart. The pulsing slows, dims, and finally dies—not with mechanical failure, but with the quiet finality of a door closing on one path so another may be walked fully. When you roll up your sleeve later that night, the display shows nothing but dark metal. The window has closed forever, and you are no longer a traveler between worlds but simply a man who has chosen his home.\n\nThe years that follow prove your choice wise beyond measure. Kleander's corruption scheme crumbles when you expose his network to authorities across Greece, strengthening your reputation as an incorruptible neutral arbiter. Your emporion becomes legendary—the Sacred Grove of Hermes where honest trade flourishes even as the Peloponnesian War tears the Greek world apart. Students come from as far as Sicily to study in your school, where they learn not just rhetoric and mathematics, but the radical idea that enemies can meet in peace. Aristomenes becomes more than a partner; he's the brother you chose, standing beside you through plague years and bitter winters, celebrating when former students return as ambassadors and philosophers. You never marry—some whisper it's because you loved a woman from a distant land—but you mentor dozens of young people who call you father in all but blood. Your Swiss Army knife becomes the stuff of legend among metalworkers, studied and copied though never equaled.\n\nAs decades pass and your hair turns white, the emporion evolves into something beyond your original vision. It's not just a trading post but a cultural bridge, where Persian scholars debate with Athenian philosophers, where Spartan warriors lay down arms to study poetry, where the first seeds of cosmopolitan Greek culture take root. You live to see Alexander march past your borders, carrying ideas that first flowered in your neutral ground to the edges of the known world. Former students become the diplomats who shape the Hellenistic age, carrying forward the principle that enemies need not remain enemies forever.\n\nOn your final morning, sitting in the shrine you built to a god of travelers, you feel no regret for the journey not taken. The time machine lies buried beneath the altar's foundation—you interred it there decades ago, knowing its purpose was complete. Around you, grandchildren of your first students play in gardens planted by Persian and Athenian hands alike. You built something that outlasted empires: proof that a stranger can become family, that neutrality is not indifference but love made practical, that home is not where you begin but where you choose to belong. The Far-Seer found his farthest shore in the place he finally chose to stay.\n\n<anchors>belonging[+0] legacy[+0] freedom[+0]</anchors>"

        "narrative": "The world fractures into blinding light, then snaps back together wrong.\n\nYour stomach lurches as cobblestones materialize beneath your stumbling feet. The acrid smell of urine and unwashed bodies hits you first, followed by wood smoke and something else - olive oil, maybe? Your jeans and hoodie feel impossibly foreign as Mediterranean sun beats down on narrow streets lined with mud-brick buildings. Voices shout in a language that sounds almost familiar but isn't quite Greek as you remember it from college.\n\nA donkey brays nearby. Women in long chitons hurry past, eyes downcast, while bearded men in short tunics gesture wildly as they argue. Your phone buzzes against your leg - somehow still getting a signal it shouldn't exist for another 2,500 years. The Swiss Army knife feels reassuring in your pocket as you notice several people staring at your strange clothes with suspicious eyes.\n\n\"Barbaros!\" someone shouts, pointing at you. The word cuts through the confusion - barbarian, foreigner. A small crowd begins to gather, their voices rising. You catch fragments: something about your appearance, questions about where you're from. A man with calloused hands approaches, speaking rapidly. When you don't respond in proper Greek, his expression hardens.\n\nThe smell of fresh bread wafts from a nearby stall, reminding you how long it's been since you've eaten. Your throat is parched, and the sun is climbing higher. The crowd grows more insistent, some pressing closer to examine your clothing. You need to act before this turns dangerous.\n\n[A] Point to your throat and make drinking motions, then gesture toward the bread stall - universal signs of hunger and thirst that might evoke sympathy\n\n[B] Pull out a handful of your strange coins and try to buy bread, hoping your foreign money will intrigue rather than alarm them\n\n[C] Begin sketching geometric shapes in the dirt with your finger - mathematics and philosophy are highly valued here, marking you as potentially useful rather than threatening\n\n\n\nYou fumble in your pocket and pull out a handful of modern quarters and dollar bills, holding them toward the bread merchant. The crowd presses closer, murmuring as they examine the strange metal discs and green paper. The baker, a stocky man with flour-dusted arms, picks up one of the quarters and bites it experimentally.\n\nHis face darkens. \"What trickery is this?\" he shouts in accented Greek you're beginning to understand. \"False silver! And what manner of papyrus bears such marks?\" Several men push forward, examining your money with growing suspicion. Someone mutters about counterfeiters, and you catch the word for \"punishment\" - not good. The baker gestures angrily, and a few onlookers nod in agreement. Your strange appearance suddenly seems less curious and more criminal.\n\nOver the following weeks, word of the \"foreign counterfeiter\" spreads through the lower agora. Merchants eye you warily when you pass, and several have refused to deal with you entirely. You've managed to survive by doing odd jobs - carrying water, cleaning stables - work that free Athenians consider beneath them but desperate foreigners must accept. Your modern clothes have drawn constant stares, forcing you to trade your hoodie for a rough chiton from a sympathetic cloth merchant who pitied your obvious poverty.\n\nThe initial suspicion has settled into grudging tolerance, but your reputation precedes you. Most assume you're a barbarian from some distant land, possibly a refugee from Persian territories. Your strange accent when attempting Greek only reinforces this theory. You've learned that metics - resident foreigners - can work and live in Athens but cannot vote or own land, and must pay a monthly tax they call the metoikion.\n\nAs autumn approaches, you realize you need a more stable situation before winter arrives.\n\n[A] Seek out the philosopher Socrates in the agora - foreign wisdom-seekers often come to Athens to learn, and intellectual curiosity might overcome suspicion of your origins\n\n[B] Approach the construction crews building Pericles' new temples - they need skilled workers and care less about your background if you can prove useful with tools\n\n[C] Offer your services as a scribe to merchants who deal with foreign traders - your ability to quickly learn languages and do precise calculations could be valuable\n\n\n\nYou climb the steep path to the Acropolis, where crews of workers swarm over the rising framework of what will become the Parthenon. The foreman, a weathered Athenian named Kleomenes, barely glances at you until you pull out your Swiss Army knife and demonstrate its precision by cleanly cutting a perfect joint in a piece of olive wood. His eyes widen as you show him the various tools folded within - the awl for marking, the small saw, the precise blade that holds its edge.\n\n\"By Hephaestus,\" he mutters, examining the craftsmanship. \"What land produces such work?\" When you mention you learned carpentry \"in the far north,\" he nods knowingly - everyone assumes barbarians have strange skills. What seals your position is when the master architect Iktinos himself arrives to inspect progress. A marble block has cracked during transport, and the masons are debating how to salvage it. You quietly suggest using the mathematical principles you remember - calculating stress points and optimal cuts. Your precise measurements, aided by your phone's calculator (which you use discretely), save the expensive stone.\n\nOver the following months, your reputation grows. The knife's superior tools make you invaluable for detailed work, and your ability to calculate complex angles impresses even the master craftsmen. Kleomenes increases your pay twice and begins consulting you on difficult problems. You've moved from the squalid quarters near the docks to a modest room near the Dipylon Gate, and other workers greet you with respect rather than suspicion.\n\nAs winter deepens, however, your success draws new attention. Wealthy citizens have begun to notice the foreign craftsman whose precision rivals the finest Athenian masters. Some whisper that such skill must come from divine favor - or dangerous sorcery. Meanwhile, your close work with the sacred temple has caught the eye of certain priests who question whether a barbarian should handle stones destined for Athena's dwelling.\n\n[A] Dedicate a portion of your earnings to Athena and publicly participate in the temple rituals - showing proper piety toward the city's patron goddess could legitimize your presence on the sacred hill\n\n[B] Seek the protection of Kleomenes by offering to teach him your \"foreign techniques\" - binding yourself to an Athenian citizen through mutual benefit\n\n[C] Begin training a young apprentice in your methods - creating a legacy of your skills while deflecting attention from yourself to your student\n\n\n\nYou choose Nikias, a sharp-eyed sixteen-year-old whose father died in the Persian wars, leaving him to support his mother and younger sister. The boy proves remarkably gifted - not just with his hands, but with the mathematical principles you carefully introduce. When you show him how to use your knife's measuring tools, he grasps the concepts immediately. More importantly, as the son of a fallen hoplite, he carries the respect that your foreign birth denies you.\n\nThe arrangement proves more successful than you dared hope. Nikias becomes your voice among the workers, explaining your techniques in proper Attic Greek while you demonstrate. When priests question certain innovations, they hear explanations from a citizen's son rather than a suspicious barbarian. The young man's natural charisma draws other apprentices, and soon you're teaching a small group the precision methods that make your work exceptional.\n\nAs spring arrives, your indirect influence spreads throughout the construction crews. Nikias has begun developing his own innovations based on your teachings, improvements that bear his name rather than yours. The other masters praise \"young Nikias's brilliant insights\" while you remain comfortably in the background. Your student now earns enough to properly support his family, and his growing reputation reflects well on both of you. Several wealthy citizens have noticed his exceptional work and begun offering private commissions.\n\nThe breakthrough comes when Nikias solves a critical problem with the Parthenon's column alignment that has puzzled Iktinos himself. The solution uses principles you taught him, but his explanation is so eloquent and mathematically sound that he's invited to present it to Pericles. Suddenly, your apprentice is being hailed as a prodigy, while you watch with mixed pride and concern as he's drawn into circles far above your reach as a metic.\n\nSuccess brings new complications. Nikias now moves among citizens who might ask uncomfortable questions about his mysterious foreign teacher.\n\n[A] Encourage Nikias to distance himself from you publicly while maintaining your private lessons - protecting both of you from scrutiny about your origins\n\n[B] Propose a formal business partnership where Nikias handles the citizen interactions while you focus on training more apprentices behind the scenes\n\n[C] Arrange for Nikias to \"discover\" and take credit for a major architectural innovation you'll secretly develop - securing his future while further obscuring your role\n\n\n\nYou and Nikias agree on the careful distance, meeting in private to continue his education while he mingles freely with citizens in public. The arrangement works well at first - too well, perhaps. Nikias's newfound status opens doors you never anticipated, but it also creates gaps you hadn't foreseen.\n\nThe complication emerges when Kallikrates, one of Athens's master architects, takes personal interest in your former apprentice. He begins inviting Nikias to symposiums and philosophical discussions, eager to understand the source of the young man's remarkable insights. Under pressure to explain his techniques, Nikias finds himself improvising answers that don't quite align with what you taught him. When Kallikrates asks to meet this mysterious \"northern teacher\" Nikias occasionally mentions, the young man grows evasive.\n\nOver the following weeks, the distance you created becomes a chasm. Nikias visits less frequently, claiming his new responsibilities leave little time for private lessons. When he does come, there's tension in his manner - gratitude mixed with something that might be shame, or perhaps fear of association with your foreign status. You overhear other workers whispering that Nikias now claims his innovations came from studying old scrolls in the Akademy, making no mention of a barbarian teacher.\n\nAs summer reaches its peak, your position grows precarious. Without Nikias as intermediary, you're once again just another foreign craftsman whose unusual skills draw suspicious glances. Some of the masters who once sought your advice now treat you with polite indifference, while newer workers question your techniques openly. Your income has dropped as the more prestigious assignments go to others, and you sense your time on the sacred hill may be ending.\n\nThe final blow comes when you realize someone has been watching your private meetings with Nikias, noting the times and locations with uncomfortable precision.\n\n[A] Approach Aspasia, Pericles' foreign-born companion - as another outsider who gained acceptance in Athens, she might offer guidance or protection\n\n[B] Seek employment with the silver mining operations at Laurion - dangerous work, but they care only about production, not origins or politics\n\n[C] Use your mathematical skills to become a money-changer in the lower agora - foreign merchants need currency exchange, and your precision with numbers could build a new reputation\n\n\n\nYou approach Aspasia's residence in the fashionable district below the Acropolis, hoping her status as an accepted foreigner might provide guidance. But your timing proves disastrous. As you wait outside her door, a group of conservative citizens emerges from a nearby symposium, voices raised in heated political debate. They notice you - clearly a barbarian by your appearance - loitering near the home of \"that Milesian woman.\"\n\n\"Another foreign schemer seeking Pericles' whore,\" one sneers loudly. Others join in, their wine-loosened tongues vicious. When you try to explain your purpose, they mock your accent and question your right to approach a citizen's household uninvited. Word spreads quickly through the neighborhood - the suspicious craftsman from the temple project was seen skulking around Aspasia's home like some barbarian spy.\n\nOver the following weeks, the incident festers into something worse. Conservative politicians, already critical of Pericles' relationship with a foreign woman, seize on your presence as evidence of dangerous foreign influence corrupting Athens. Someone spreads rumors that you're part of a network of barbarian agents, using your temple work to gather intelligence. The fact that your techniques seem impossibly advanced only feeds the paranoia.\n\nAspasia herself, when you finally manage a brief encounter in the agora, is polite but distant. \"I cannot help you,\" she says quietly. \"My own position requires... careful management of associations.\" Her eyes convey sympathy, but her words are final. Any connection to you would only provide ammunition for her enemies.\n\nAs autumn approaches, you find yourself increasingly isolated. The temple work has dried up entirely, and even basic laboring jobs become scarce as word of your \"suspicious activities\" spreads. Your savings dwindle, and you're forced to move to cheaper quarters in the rougher districts near the harbor. The other foreign workers eye you warily, unwilling to risk association with someone marked as potentially dangerous.\n\nWinter looms, and with it the prospect of real hardship if you cannot find sustainable work soon.\n\n[A] Volunteer for military service as a rower in the Athenian fleet - foreign residents can serve, and military service might restore your reputation while providing steady pay\n\n[B] Seek work among the potters and metalworkers in the Kerameikos district - craftsmen there are less concerned with politics and more interested in skill\n\n[C] Approach the mystery cults at Eleusis - religious communities sometimes offer sanctuary to outsiders, and your foreign origins might be seen as bringing exotic wisdom rather than suspicion\n\n\n\nYou make the journey to Eleusis as the leaves begin to turn, hoping the sacred precinct might offer sanctuary. The Eleusinian Mysteries welcome initiates from across the Greek world, and foreign wisdom-seekers often find acceptance here. But your approach proves poorly timed - you arrive during the sacred month when the initiates are undergoing purification rites, and outsiders are strictly forbidden from the temple grounds.\n\nThe hierophant who greets you at the outer gate listens politely to your request but shakes his head. \"The goddess does not call to you now,\" he says diplomatically. \"Perhaps when the season of mysteries passes...\" But there's something in his manner that suggests news of your reputation has preceded you even here. A junior priest whispers urgently in his ear, and you catch fragments - something about \"political complications\" and \"questions from Athens.\"\n\nOver the following weeks, you linger in the small town outside the sanctuary, taking odd jobs and hoping for an opportunity. The locals are kind enough, but wary of becoming involved with someone who clearly carries troubles from the city. You help with the olive harvest and repair tools for farmers, but it's subsistence work that barely covers food and shelter. Your Swiss Army knife continues to amaze the rural craftsmen, but without the context of the great construction projects, your skills seem less miraculous and more simply useful.\n\nAs winter deepens, you realize the religious path offers no immediate refuge. The mystery cults operate on their own timeline, and your political entanglements in Athens have created complications that even divine sanctuary cannot easily resolve. The priests make it clear that any formal association would require extensive purification rites and waiting periods that could stretch for months.\n\nYour funds run dangerously low, and the mountain cold bites deeper each night. You need to make a decisive move before winter traps you in poverty.\n\n[A] Return to Athens and seek work in the dangerous but lucrative silver mines at Laurion - they need skilled workers and care little about political reputation\n\n[B] Head to the port city of Piraeus to work the docks and merchant ships - the cosmopolitan harbor attracts foreigners and offers anonymity among the crowds\n\n[C] Travel to one of the smaller allied cities that pay tribute to Athens - your reputation might not have spread there, and your skills could be more valued in less sophisticated communities\n\n\n\n[The time machine window opens]\nYou set out for Aegina, one of Athens' island tributaries, hoping distance might have dulled news of your troubles. The ferry crossing drains most of your remaining coins, and when you arrive, you discover the island is in the grip of political turmoil. Aegina chafes under Athenian dominance, and anti-Athenian sentiment runs high. Your association with the Parthenon construction - which used tribute money extorted from islands like this one - makes you a target rather than an asset.\n\nThe local craftsmen view you with open hostility once they learn of your temple work. \"Another Athenian lackey come to steal our jobs,\" spits one potter. When you explain you're merely a foreign worker, they laugh bitterly. \"Foreign worker building monuments to Athenian glory with our silver? You chose your masters poorly, barbarian.\" Your reputation as a skilled craftsman means nothing here - if anything, it marks you as complicit in Athens' imperial exploitation.\n\nOver the following bitter weeks, you barely survive on the charity of a few sympathetic fishermen. The island's economy offers little opportunity, especially for someone tainted by Athenian connections. You've considered swimming back to the mainland, but winter storms make the crossing treacherous. Your modern items remain hidden, but even your superior tools cannot create work where none exists. The isolation feels complete - cut off from Athens by scandal, rejected here by politics you never understood.\n\nThen, as you sit watching the grey winter sea from a rocky outcrop, your wrist device suddenly pulses with warm light. The small display flickers to life, showing coordinates you don't recognize and a timer counting down from hours, not years. The window has opened. You could leave this era entirely - escape the political entanglements, the suspicion, the grinding poverty that has become your life. But you think of Nikias, still building his career on foundations you laid. Of techniques that might yet transform how these people build and create.\n\n[A] Activate the time machine and leave this era behind\n\n[B] Return to Athens despite the risks - use the remaining window time to reconnect with Nikias and salvage what you built there\n\n[C] Stay on Aegina and try to prove your worth to the islanders through hard work - the window will remain open a little longer if you need to reconsider\n\n\n\nYou scrape together coin for the ferry back to Piraeus, the device's steady pulsing a constant reminder of your escape route. The crossing is rough, winter swells tossing the small vessel, and you arrive in Athens soaked and shivering. Your timing proves unfortunate - the city is in the grip of religious festival preparations, and strangers draw extra scrutiny from guards already on high alert.\n\nMoving through the familiar streets feels surreal with the device pulsing against your wrist. You make your way to Nikias's modest home near the agora, but when you arrive, his younger sister Thalia answers the door with wide, frightened eyes. \"He's not here,\" she whispers, glancing nervously over her shoulder. \"The archons came asking questions about his teacher. He's staying with our uncle until...\" She trails off, but the meaning is clear - your political troubles have finally caught up with your former student.\n\nYou manage to arrange a brief meeting at a wine shop in the Kerameikos district, away from prying eyes. Nikias arrives looking haggard, his success of months ago now a burden. \"They're saying you were a Persian spy,\" he says quietly. \"That your techniques were too advanced, too precise - that no barbarian could know such things without foreign backing.\" He glances around nervously. \"Kallikrates has been asking uncomfortable questions about where I really learned my methods.\"\n\nThe reunion is bittersweet. Despite the danger, Nikias has continued developing your teachings, and he shows you sketches of innovations that make your heart swell with pride. But the political climate makes any public acknowledgment impossible. \"I want to help you,\" he says earnestly, \"but any association puts my family at risk.\"\n\nThe device pulses more insistently now, its light visible even through your sleeve. Time is running short for this decision.\n\n[A] Activate the time machine and leave this era behind\n\n[B] Ask Nikias to help you flee Athens by land, heading for friendlier territories - the window will remain open for one more moment\n\n[C] Stay and face the accusations directly, using your knowledge to prove your value to the city - the window will remain open for one more moment\n\n\n\nYou decide to face the accusations head-on, and fortune smiles on your boldness. As you and Nikias discuss strategy, a commotion erupts in the street outside - a building collapse has trapped several workers, and the city's engineers are baffled by the unstable rubble. Your Swiss Army knife and mathematical precision prove crucial in calculating safe extraction angles, and your careful work saves three lives, including that of a prominent citizen's son.\n\nWord of your heroics spreads rapidly through Athens. The same crowds who once whispered about Persian spies now speak of the foreign craftsman who risked his life for Athenian citizens. More importantly, your rescue techniques demonstrate practical knowledge that no spy would possess - you understand construction because you've spent months building, not plotting. The grateful father, a wealthy pottery merchant named Xenophanes, publicly vouches for your character and offers his patronage.\n\nWithin days, the political tide turns completely. Kallikrates himself seeks you out, no longer suspicious but curious about your \"northern building traditions.\" You're invited to demonstrate your techniques to a gathering of master craftsmen, where your careful explanations - filtered through Nikias's more polished Greek - earn respect rather than suspicion. Several offer you work on private projects, finally seeing your foreign origins as an asset rather than a threat.\n\nThe device on your wrist pulses with increasing urgency - bright flashes that seem almost desperate. This is your last chance to escape, the final moment before the window closes for another year. But around you, the life you've built is finally bearing fruit. Nikias beams with pride as masters praise the \"collaborative innovations\" you've developed together. Citizens nod respectfully as you pass. For the first time since arriving, Athens feels less like a trap and more like home.\n\nThe choice burns bright against your wrist - leave now, or commit to a full year in this dangerous, magnificent city.\n\n[A] Activate the time machine and leave this era behind. This is your last chance - the next window won't open for about another year.\n\n[B] Accept Xenophanes' offer of permanent patronage and establish yourself as a respected foreign craftsman - but know the next window won't open for about another year.\n\n[C] Propose a formal partnership with Nikias to establish a workshop teaching advanced techniques - but know the next window won't open for about another year.\n\n\n\n[You activate the time machine]\nYour hand moves to the device before conscious thought intervenes. The pulsing light feels warm against your palm as you press the activation sequence.\n\nIn that final second, you see Nikias through the wine shop window, sketching furiously in the dirt as he explains your joint technique to a fascinated crowd of craftsmen. His face glows with the pride of a teacher passing on knowledge. Behind him, the half-finished Parthenon rises against the azure sky, marble columns that will stand for millennia - some cut with precision your tools made possible.\n\nThe device hums once, a sound like distant thunder.\n\nReality fractures into light and possibility. The wine shop, the excited voices, Nikias's proud smile - all of it dissolves into brilliant white. Your last thought is of the workshop you might have built together, the students who might have carried those techniques across the Greek world, the legacy that could have been carved in stone and memory.\n\nThe light fades. Athens, and all its golden promise, is gone.\n\n"
