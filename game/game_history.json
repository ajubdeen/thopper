        "narrative": "The world lurches sideways and your stomach drops as if you've fallen off a cliff. One moment you were in your garage in Palo Alto, the next you're stumbling onto sun-baked stone, ears ringing from the transition. The acrid smell of olive oil, sweat, and something else—human waste?—hits you like a wall. Your jeans and t-shirt feel absurdly out of place as sandaled feet shuffle past, their owners draped in rough wool and linen.\n\nYou're in some kind of marketplace. Men in short tunics argue over clay amphorae while women peer from beneath veils. The Greek you studied in college comes flooding back as you catch fragments: \"...silver from Laurion...\" \"...ships from Egypt...\" A few people stare at your strange clothes, whispering. One bearded man points and says something about \"barbarian cloth.\"\n\nYour heart hammers as you realize how exposed you are. These people have never seen denim, never seen a printed t-shirt. A small crowd begins to gather, their voices rising. Someone mentions taking you to the archons—the magistrates. You catch the word \"spy\" and \"Persian.\" The second Persian War only ended a generation ago. Being mistaken for an enemy could be fatal.\n\nA muscular man with calloused hands steps closer, speaking slowly as if to a child: \"Who are you, stranger? What polis do you serve?\" The crowd presses in, waiting for your answer. You need to respond quickly before this escalates.\n\n[A] Claim to be a traveling merchant from a distant land beyond their knowledge, hoping your strange goods will seem valuable rather than suspicious.\n\n[B] Pretend to be a shipwrecked survivor who has lost everything, appealing to Greek hospitality customs toward suppliants.\n\n[C] Present yourself as a philosopher seeking wisdom, knowing that Athens respects intellectual visitors and foreign teachers.\n\n<anchors>belonging[0] legacy[0] freedom[0]</anchors>\n\nYou drop to your knees on the rough stone, arms outstretched in the formal posture of a suppliant. \"I throw myself upon your mercy,\" you cry out in halting Greek. \"My ship foundered in a storm—everything lost to Poseidon's fury. I am Xenios, cast upon your shores with nothing but my life.\"\n\nThe crowd's mood shifts instantly. Several men step back, making the sign against evil. In Greek culture, suppliants are sacred—to harm one risks the gods' wrath. The muscular man who questioned you now looks troubled rather than suspicious. \"Stranger, if you truly seek Zeus Xenios's protection...\" He glances at the others, then nods slowly. \"I am Kleomenes, potter of the Kerameikos. My wife will not forgive me if I turn away one blessed by the god of hospitality.\"\n\nOver the following weeks, your gambit pays off beyond your wildest hopes. Kleomenes and his family take you in, providing food, shelter, and rough clothing that helps you blend in. His wife Penthesilea treats you kindly but keeps her distance—proper for a woman with a strange man in the house. Their teenage son Nikias becomes fascinated by your odd accent and occasional slips into concepts that don't exist yet. You learn the rhythm of Athenian life: the agora's bustle, the workshops' hammer-song, the evening symposiums where men recline and debate philosophy over wine.\n\nBut as the season turns toward autumn, questions multiply. Other potters ask about your family, your polis, your training. Your story of shipwreck explains your lack of possessions, but not your ignorance of basic pottery techniques or your strange knowledge of distant places. When you accidentally mention concepts like \"democracy in the future\" or reference events that haven't happened yet, people exchange worried glances.\n\nOne evening, Kleomenes pulls you aside. \"Friend Xenios, there are whispers. Some say you speak like an oracle—knowing things you shouldn't know. Others wonder if you're a Persian spy with an elaborate story. I believe in your shipwreck, but you must establish yourself properly in Athens, or suspicion will grow dangerous.\"\n\n[A] Seek work in the silver mines at Laurion, where desperate men ask few questions and your strange knowledge might help you survive the brutal conditions.\n\n[B] Offer your services to the city as a foreign teacher, following the tradition of wise men like Anaxagoras who came from abroad to educate Athenian youth.\n\n[C] Approach the temple of Hephaestus near the Agora, claiming the god of craftsmanship sent you visions in dreams—explaining your odd knowledge while gaining religious protection.\n\n<anchors>belonging[+5] legacy[0] freedom[-3]</anchors>\n\nYour decision to present yourself as a teacher proves inspired. Kleomenes introduces you to Hipponikos, a wealthy citizen whose son needs tutoring in mathematics and natural philosophy. When you demonstrate your knowledge—casually explaining geometric principles that won't be \"discovered\" for decades and discussing the movements of celestial bodies with startling precision—Hipponikos's eyes widen with genuine amazement.\n\n\"By the gods,\" he whispers after you predict a lunar eclipse to the day. \"You truly are touched by divine wisdom.\" Word spreads quickly through Athens's elite circles. The foreign teacher who knows impossible things becomes the season's fascination. Wealthy families compete to hire you, and your rates climb steadily.\n\nOver the following weeks, your reputation solidifies. You're careful to frame your knowledge as \"dreams from Apollo\" or \"visions granted by Athena,\" which satisfies Greek curiosity about your impossible insights. Your students include the sons of prominent citizens—young men who will shape Athens's future. When you subtly introduce concepts of hygiene to prevent disease, or demonstrate principles of engineering that could improve their siege engines, they hang on every word.\n\nThe money flows freely now. You've moved into your own modest house near the Agora, with a slave named Thrax to manage household duties. Your success, however, draws unexpected attention. As winter approaches, a messenger arrives with an invitation that makes your blood run cold: Pericles himself requests your presence. The most powerful man in Athens has heard of the foreign teacher with impossible knowledge.\n\n\"The strategos wishes to discuss philosophy,\" the messenger explains. \"He's particularly interested in your... unique perspectives on statecraft and the future of Athens.\" But there's something in his tone that suggests this isn't merely social curiosity. Pericles is brilliant, suspicious, and utterly ruthless with threats to Athenian power.\n\n[A] Accept the invitation immediately, bringing gifts and demonstrating complete deference to avoid seeming like a threat to his authority.\n\n[B] Request a delay to properly prepare, using the time to research Pericles' current political challenges so you can offer genuinely useful advice.\n\n[C] Approach Aspasia first—as Pericles' foreign-born partner, she understands the delicate position of influential outsiders and might provide crucial guidance.\n\n<anchors>belonging[+8] legacy[+12] freedom[-5]</anchors>\n\nYour attempt to reach Aspasia proves more complicated than expected. As a foreign woman, even one of her stature, she doesn't move freely through Athens like a citizen male. Your first inquiries at symposiums are met with raised eyebrows—respectable men don't discuss seeking private audience with another man's hetaira, even one as intellectually renowned as Aspasia.\n\nWhen you finally make contact through a chain of intermediaries, the meeting itself becomes problematic. Aspasia agrees to see you, but only in the presence of other women at a religious festival honoring Demeter. The conversation must be carefully coded, speaking in metaphors about \"navigating storms\" and \"foreign seeds taking root in Attic soil.\" She's brilliant and immediately grasps your situation, but warns that your approach has already created gossip.\n\n\"Pericles has heard you sought me out before answering his summons,\" she says quietly, pretending to examine votive offerings. \"He sees this as either clever—understanding the value of counsel—or suspicious—foreign conspirators conferring in secret.\" Her dark eyes meet yours briefly. \"Your reputation for impossible knowledge already troubles him. Some whisper you're a Persian mystic sent to bewitch Athenian minds.\"\n\nOver the following weeks, the delay costs you. While you waited for the meeting with Aspasia, then processed her advice, Pericles' invitation has transformed into something more formal and less friendly. The summons now comes through official channels, couched in language that suggests investigation rather than philosophical discourse. Your students' families begin expressing quiet concerns. The wealthy Hipponikos mentions that \"certain citizens\" have questioned your loyalty to Athens.\n\nYet Aspasia's counsel proves invaluable. She's given you crucial intelligence: Pericles fears that Sparta is infiltrating Athens with foreign agents posing as teachers and philosophers. Your timing couldn't be worse—or perhaps more revealing of your true nature.\n\n[A] Present yourself to Pericles with complete honesty about your origins, gambling that the impossible truth might be more believable than any lie.\n\n[B] Offer to prove your loyalty by providing intelligence about Spartan military tactics, using your historical knowledge to give Athens genuine strategic advantages.\n\n[C] Propose hosting a public demonstration of your teaching methods in the Theater of Dionysus, letting all citizens witness your wisdom and judge your character openly—following the Athenian tradition of deciding important matters through public scrutiny.\n\n<anchors>belonging[+3] legacy[+5] freedom[-8]</anchors>\n\nYour meeting with Pericles in his private study begins promisingly. When you offer detailed knowledge of Spartan military formations—describing their phalanx tactics, the organization of their army by age groups, and weaknesses in their siege capabilities—his sharp eyes gleam with interest. But your luck sours when you reveal too much too quickly.\n\n\"Fascinating,\" Pericles says, leaning forward. \"Tell me, how does a shipwrecked teacher know that Sparta trains their warriors in groups of thirty-five, when our own spies report conflicting numbers?\" His voice grows dangerously quiet. \"And how do you know about their new iron-working techniques from the Messenian helots? That intelligence only reached us three days ago through... very specific channels.\"\n\nThe trap snaps shut around you. Your historical knowledge, meant to prove loyalty, instead reveals impossible accuracy about current military secrets. Pericles summons two guards, and suddenly you're not a honored guest but a suspected spy under house arrest. Over the following weeks, as winter deepens, investigators comb through your life in Athens. They question your students, examine your teaching methods, and press Kleomenes about your early days in the city.\n\nThe accusations multiply beyond your control. Someone claims they saw you making strange marks—your occasional notes in English alphabet. Another swears you predicted a grain shipment's arrival date with suspicious precision. Your former patron Hipponikos, fearing association with a traitor, publicly distances himself. Students' families cancel their contracts. The comfortable life you built crumbles as Athens' paranoia focuses on you.\n\nYet you're not entirely powerless. Your house arrest is loose—more surveillance than imprisonment—and you still have allies. Thrax, your household slave, remains loyal and serves as messenger. Some of your former students quietly express doubt about the charges. Aspasia, through careful intermediaries, hints that not everyone in Pericles' circle believes you're a threat.\n\n[A] Attempt to escape Athens entirely, using your knowledge of the countryside and historical events to evade pursuit and seek refuge in a neutral polis.\n\n[B] Demand trial by jury in the Athenian courts, trusting that your reputation as a teacher and the weakness of evidence might sway the democratic assembly.\n\n[C] Offer to submit to the sacred test of the Delphic Oracle, proposing that Apollo himself judge your innocence—a gambit that would either vindicate you completely or destroy you utterly.\n\n<anchors>belonging[-5] legacy[-3] freedom[-10]</anchors>\n\nYour escape from Athens begins well enough. Thrax helps you slip away during a religious procession when your watchers are distracted, and your knowledge of ancient geography serves you initially. You know which mountain passes lead to neutral territories, which roads the Athenians patrol most heavily. But your luck falters when winter storms strike earlier than expected, turning familiar paths into treacherous mud and forcing you to take shelter in villages where strangers draw unwanted attention.\n\nThe delay proves costly. In a small farming settlement near Megara, your accent and inability to explain your presence convincingly raises suspicions. The village headman, loyal to Athens and eager to curry favor, sends word of the suspicious foreigner matching the description of Pericles' escaped prisoner. By the time you realize your mistake and flee, Athenian cavalry are already riding hard along the coastal roads.\n\nOver the following weeks, you're reduced to hiding in caves and olive groves, scavenging what food you can. Your modern clothes, long since replaced by Greek garb, can't protect you from the mountain cold. The Swiss Army knife proves invaluable for survival tasks, but you're always one step ahead of pursuit. Twice you barely avoid Athenian search parties by hiding in sacred groves where soldiers won't enter after dark.\n\nAs spring arrives, your situation grows desperate rather than better. You're branded an outlaw throughout Attica, cut off from civilized shelter. Wild animals and bandits pose constant threats in the remote areas where you're forced to hide. Your smartphone's battery, even with the solar charger, runs dangerously low from overuse of the compass function during nighttime navigation.\n\nBut opportunity comes from an unexpected source. While foraging near the border with Boeotia, you encounter a group of Theban merchants whose cart has broken down. Their leader, Aristomenes, eyes you warily but seems more interested in your obvious desperation than any bounty on your head.\n\n\"You have the look of a man with nothing left to lose,\" he observes. \"Such men can be useful, if they're willing to work for honest silver rather than steal it.\"\n\n[A] Offer your services as a guide and translator for their trading expeditions, using your geographical knowledge to help them find profitable new routes.\n\n[B] Propose to teach their children and household slaves to read and write, establishing yourself as a valuable asset worth protecting from Athenian pursuit.\n\n[C] Suggest they hire you to help negotiate with the Oracle at Delphi on their behalf, knowing that your \"divine visions\" could provide the merchants with seemingly prophetic guidance for their business ventures.\n\n<anchors>belonging[-8] legacy[-5] freedom[+12]</anchors>\n\nYour gambit with Aristomenes pays off spectacularly. When you guide his caravan to a previously unknown river crossing that saves them three days of travel, then help them avoid bandits by suggesting an alternate route through sacred groves, the Theban merchant becomes convinced you're blessed by Hermes, god of travelers and trade. Your knowledge of ancient geography—where settlements will grow, which mountain passes stay clear longest—seems like divine inspiration to men who navigate by landmarks and local reputation.\n\nWithin weeks, you've become invaluable to his trading network. You lead them to deposits of high-quality clay that potters will prize, guide them to fishing villages with abundant catches perfect for inland markets, and most lucratively, direct them to communities with surplus grain just as other cities face shortages. Your smartphone's offline maps, carefully consulted in private, reveal mineral deposits and geographic features that won't be discovered for centuries.\n\nOver the following months, as spring turns to summer, your reputation spreads through Boeotian merchant circles. You're known as \"Xenios the Far-Seer,\" the foreign guide whose routes never fail. The silver flows freely—enough to buy proper clothes, weapons, and your own pack animals. More importantly, you've earned protection. When Athenian agents inquire about a fugitive teacher, Theban merchants claim they've never heard of such a man. They only know a valuable trading partner who brings them profit.\n\nThe work suits you in ways you hadn't expected. Days on mountain trails, nights around campfires sharing stories with hardened traders, the satisfaction of successful negotiations in foreign markets—it's a life of constant movement and challenge. Yet as autumn approaches, Aristomenes makes an offer that could change everything.\n\n\"The Pythian Games approach at Delphi,\" he says over evening wine. \"All the great merchants will gather, along with representatives from every polis. It's dangerous for you—Athens will have agents there—but also an opportunity. If you could guide our expedition to victory in the trade competitions, we'd all be rich beyond measure.\"\n\n[A] Accept the challenge and travel to Delphi, using your knowledge of historical events to help the merchants succeed at the games despite the risk of Athenian discovery.\n\n[B] Propose establishing a permanent trading post in a remote but strategically located valley, creating a safe base of operations while building something lasting.\n\n[C] Suggest forming an alliance with the Delphic priests by offering to interpret \"divine signs\" for pilgrims, knowing that religious sanctuary could protect you from political enemies while legitimizing your prophetic abilities.\n\n<anchors>belonging[+12] legacy[+8] freedom[+3]</anchors>\n\nYour proposal to establish a permanent trading post excites Aristomenes and his partners. You identify a perfect valley—defensible, with fresh water and natural shelter, positioned along a route that will become crucial in future conflicts. The merchants pool their silver to purchase the land from local farmers, and construction begins with high hopes. Your knowledge of engineering principles helps design storage facilities and defensive walls that impress even experienced builders.\n\nBut the venture quickly encounters problems you couldn't foresee. The local Boeotian council, initially welcoming, grows suspicious when they realize how strategically valuable your chosen location truly is. They demand additional tribute payments and impose restrictions on which goods can be stored there. Worse, the farmers you displaced prove more troublesome than expected—several have relatives in positions of minor authority who begin questioning why foreigners should control such prime territory.\n\nOver the following weeks, as winter sets in, the complications multiply. A harsh early freeze destroys much of the construction work, splitting timber and cracking newly-laid stone foundations. The costs spiral beyond the merchants' initial investment, forcing them to take on debt with Theban moneylenders at ruinous interest rates. Some of your trading partners begin grumbling that the \"Far-Seer's\" vision has led them into a costly trap.\n\nMost dangerously, the attention drawn by your ambitious project reaches unwelcome ears. A Spartan envoy, traveling through Boeotia on diplomatic business, takes particular interest in your fortified trading post so close to Attica's border. He asks pointed questions about the foreign architect who designed such sophisticated defenses. Meanwhile, Athenian merchants visiting Theban markets hear rumors of a mysterious trader whose geographical knowledge seems impossibly precise.\n\nYour time machine indicator, dark for months, suddenly pulses with faint light as you examine the half-built walls in the morning frost. The window isn't open yet, but something has changed. The device seems to respond to moments of transition, of choices that define who you become.\n\nAristomenes approaches with grim news. \"The Spartans are asking too many questions,\" he says quietly. \"And our Theban creditors grow impatient. We need a solution, friend, before this venture ruins us all.\"\n\n[A] Cut your losses and dissolve the partnership, distributing what assets remain and scattering to different cities before the political heat intensifies.\n\n[B] Double down by recruiting skilled craftsmen and former soldiers to turn the trading post into a proper fortress-town, creating something too valuable for any power to destroy.\n\n[C] Invoke the ancient Greek tradition of establishing an emporion—a neutral trading sanctuary under divine protection—by dedicating the post to Hermes and seeking recognition from the Amphictyonic League.\n\n<anchors>belonging[+8] legacy[+15] freedom[-12]</anchors>\n\nYour gambit to invoke divine protection proves moderately successful. The formal dedication to Hermes provides exactly the political cover you hoped for—neither Sparta nor Athens can openly threaten a sanctified trading post without risking the gods' wrath. The Amphictyonic League, after lengthy deliberation and generous offerings, grants limited recognition to your emporion. The sacred boundaries are marked with stone herms, and a small shrine to Hermes Agoraios rises at the settlement's heart.\n\nHowever, the process consumes months of negotiations and nearly bankrupts your merchant partners. The required offerings, ceremonial feasts, and bribes to various officials drain your remaining silver reserves. The League's recognition comes with strict limitations—you can facilitate trade but cannot store weapons or offer permanent residence to political refugees. Some of the Theban creditors remain unsatisfied, and you're forced to accept reduced profits to maintain the peace.\n\nOver the following season, as spring arrives, your emporion begins to function as intended. Merchants from across the Greek world stop to trade under Hermes' protection, and the steady flow of transaction fees slowly rebuilds your finances. Your reputation as the architect of this neutral ground spreads, though it also makes you more visible to those who would rather see you disappear. Still, the religious sanctuary provides genuine safety—even Athenian agents cannot openly move against you here.\n\nThe settlement grows modestly but steadily. Craftsmen set up workshops within the sacred boundaries, pilgrims leave offerings at the shrine, and your Swiss Army knife becomes legendary among the metalworkers who marvel at its impossible precision. Yet success brings new challenges. As your influence increases, so do expectations. Local communities look to you for arbitration in trade disputes. Neighboring poleis seek your counsel on commercial ventures.\n\nYour time machine's indicator pulses more frequently now, the light growing stronger each week. You've built something lasting, created relationships that anchor you to this time and place. But the device seems to sense your growing entanglement, responding to the depth of your commitment with increasing urgency.\n\nOne morning, Aristomenes brings troubling news. \"There's talk of war,\" he says grimly. \"Sparta masses troops, Athens recalls her fleets. When the fighting starts, even sacred ground may not protect us. We need to decide—do we prepare for siege, or find ways to profit from the coming conflict?\"\n\n[A] Transform the emporion into a neutral meeting ground where both sides can negotiate safely, positioning yourself as an essential mediator in the coming war.\n\n[B] Establish secret supply lines to provision whichever side offers better terms, using your geographical knowledge to create smuggling routes through supposedly impassable terrain.\n\n[C] Propose hosting the Hermaia festival—sacred games honoring your patron god—creating an annual tradition that would make your settlement too culturally important to attack even during wartime.\n\n<anchors>belonging[+15] legacy[+20] freedom[-8]</anchors>\n\nYour attempt to position the emporion as a neutral meeting ground begins promisingly when both Athenian and Spartan envoys agree to preliminary talks under Hermes' protection. The sacred boundaries seem to offer exactly the diplomatic sanctuary needed for delicate negotiations. But your luck sours catastrophically during the first major conference when a young Athenian diplomat—one of your former students, now grown to manhood—recognizes you despite your weathered appearance and changed circumstances.\n\n\"By the gods,\" Nikias whispers during a break in negotiations, \"you're the teacher who fled Athens. Xenios the supposed spy.\" Word spreads rapidly through both delegations. The Spartans, already suspicious of Athenian tricks, assume your presence proves the entire meeting is an elaborate trap. The Athenians, led by a hardline faction that remembers Pericles' concerns about your impossible knowledge, see confirmation of their worst fears about foreign infiltration.\n\nOver the following weeks, the diplomatic crisis spirals beyond your control. Both sides withdraw from negotiations, each blaming the other for harboring a known enemy agent. Your carefully built reputation as a neutral mediator crumbles overnight. Worse, the scandal reaches the Amphictyonic League, which begins reconsidering the emporion's sacred status. Several member cities question whether divine protection should extend to those who deceive the gods about their true nature.\n\nThe settlement itself begins to fracture under the pressure. Some merchants flee rather than face association with a suspected spy. Others, loyal to your years of successful partnership, stand by you but suffer as trade routes dry up. Aristomenes grows haggard trying to manage creditors who see the political chaos as excuse to call in debts immediately.\n\nYour time machine's indicator now pulses almost continuously, the light growing brighter with each passing day. The device seems to sense the collapse of everything you've built here, responding to your diminishing ties with increasing urgency to escape. Yet people still depend on you—craftsmen who invested their life savings, families who've made homes within the sacred boundaries, partnerships forged over months of shared hardship.\n\nStanding in the shrine at dawn, watching the morning light catch the bronze of Hermes' statue, you realize you've reached a crossroads that will define not just your survival, but who you choose to be.\n\n[A] Make a public confession of your true origins to both Athenian and Spartan representatives, gambling that the impossible truth might restore your credibility as a neutral party.\n\n[B] Secretly contact the Delphic Oracle and arrange for a \"divine revelation\" that vouches for your character, using your historical knowledge to craft prophecies that will seem authentically inspired.\n\n[C] Activate the time machine now, before the situation deteriorates further, abandoning the settlement and people who trusted you to preserve your own freedom.\n\n<anchors>belonging[+20] legacy[+25] freedom[-15]</anchors>\n\nYour clandestine journey to Delphi proves masterfully executed. Using your knowledge of the Oracle's operations—how the Pythia delivers prophecies, when the sacred vapors are strongest, which priests control access—you arrange a private consultation that appears entirely legitimate. Your carefully crafted \"divine revelations\" blend perfect historical accuracy with vague enough language to seem authentically oracular. You predict the exact timing of a Corinthian grain shortage, reference specific Spartan military movements that won't be public knowledge for weeks, and most convincingly, describe Athenian naval operations with impossible precision.\n\nThe Pythia, whether genuinely inspired or simply impressed by your uncanny accuracy, delivers a thunderous pronouncement that echoes throughout the Greek world: \"The stranger called Xenios serves truth itself. He who questions his neutrality questions the gods' wisdom. Let all who seek honest commerce find sanctuary in his sacred ground.\" The Oracle's validation carries such weight that even your former accusers must publicly accept it or risk appearing impious.\n\nOver the following months, as autumn deepens into winter, your vindication transforms from religious pronouncement into political reality. The same Athenian diplomat who recognized you now speaks grudgingly of divine intervention. Spartan representatives, deeply reverent of oracular pronouncements, begin treating you with newfound respect. The Amphictyonic League not only reaffirms your emporion's sacred status but grants expanded privileges, allowing you to host official diplomatic meetings under Apollo's protection as well as Hermes'.\n\nTrade returns in force as confidence rebuilds. Your settlement becomes the premier neutral ground for inter-polis negotiations, with permanent ambassadors from major cities establishing residences within the sacred boundaries. The fees from diplomatic services, combined with renewed commercial activity, make you wealthier than your teaching days in Athens ever did. More importantly, you've created something unprecedented—a truly neutral space in a world increasingly divided by the approaching war.\n\nYour time machine's pulsing has grown urgent, the light now bright enough to see even in daylight. The device seems to recognize that you've reached a pinnacle of achievement here, your influence spreading throughout the Greek world. Yet this success has also created the deepest bonds you've ever formed—not just business partnerships, but genuine friendships forged through shared crisis and triumph.\n\nAs you stand in the expanded shrine, now adorned with offerings from across Greece, Aristomenes approaches with news that crystallizes the moment of choice: \"The Great War has begun in earnest. Athens and Sparta both request our services as the primary neutral ground for prisoner exchanges and peace negotiations. We'll be at the center of history itself.\"\n\n[A] Accept the role as the war's primary neutral mediator, knowing your historical knowledge could help end the conflict years early and save countless lives.\n\n[B] Gradually withdraw from active mediation while maintaining the emporion's neutral status, focusing on preserving what you've built rather than risking it in the larger conflict.\n\n[C] Use your influence to quietly evacuate non-combatants from cities you know will face siege, establishing refugee camps under religious protection without revealing how you know which places will fall.\n\n<anchors>belonging[+25] legacy[+30] freedom[-20]</anchors>\n\nYour decision to step back from active mediation while maintaining the emporion's neutrality proves wise and sustainable. You delegate the most sensitive diplomatic meetings to trusted associates while remaining available for consultation, creating a buffer between yourself and the war's most dangerous political currents. The arrangement works smoothly—both sides respect your sacred ground while you avoid the impossible position of trying to broker peace between powers destined for decades of conflict.\n\nOver the following seasons, your careful withdrawal allows the settlement to flourish in ways direct involvement might have prevented. Free from the pressure of constant high-stakes negotiations, you focus on developing the emporion's infrastructure and community. New workshops spring up within the sacred boundaries, a small but excellent school attracts students from across Greece, and your trading network expands to include routes reaching as far as the Black Sea colonies.\n\nThe war rages around your neutral sanctuary, but your measured approach keeps the settlement prosperous and safe. You facilitate prisoner exchanges and occasional truces without claiming credit for grand diplomacy. Your former students, now grown to positions of influence in various cities, quietly send their own children to study at your school. The fees from diplomatic services remain steady, while expanded trade brings wealth without the constant threat of political miscalculation.\n\nYet as winter approaches, marking nearly a full year since the war began, you face an unexpected challenge. Your success in remaining neutral has attracted attention from those who profit from prolonged conflict. A group of arms dealers and mercenary captains, led by a scarred Corinthian named Kleander, approaches with a proposition that's barely disguised as a threat.\n\n\"Neutrality is profitable,\" Kleander says, examining the shrine's expensive offerings with calculating eyes. \"But imagine how much more profitable the right kind of... selective neutrality could be. Certain information about enemy movements, strategic delays in prisoner exchanges, temporary equipment storage for the highest bidder.\"\n\nYour time machine pulses steadily now, its light so bright that you sometimes notice it even through your sleeve during daylight hours. The window hasn't opened yet, but something fundamental is shifting. The device seems to sense that your current stability, however comfortable, may not last indefinitely.\n\n[A] Firmly reject their proposition and strengthen your defenses, relying on religious sanctuary and allied merchants to protect your genuine neutrality.\n\n[B] Pretend to consider their offer while secretly gathering information about their network to expose them to the proper authorities in multiple cities.\n\n[C] Invoke the ancient tradition of the Sacred Truce by declaring a permanent hieros topos around your settlement, seeking recognition from the Olympic authorities that would make any violation a crime against all Greeks.\n\n<anchors>belonging[+15] legacy[+20] freedom[-10]</anchors>\n\n[The time machine window opens]\nThe device against your wrist grows warm—not uncomfortably so, but with the unmistakable pulse you've learned to recognize. As Kleander continues outlining his corrupt proposition, you feel the familiar thrum against your skin, see the faint glow even through your sleeve. The small display shows the date clearly: -431, Classical Athens. The window is open.\n\nYour mind races as the Corinthian talks. Around you stands everything you've built—the bustling workshops where craftsmen create beauty that will outlast empires, the school where young minds wrestle with ideas that will shape philosophy for millennia, the shrine where honest merchants find sanctuary from a world gone mad with war. Aristomenes catches your eye from across the courtyard, concern creasing his weathered face as he watches this unwelcome delegation. Students pause in their exercises, sensing tension. The cook who makes your favorite barley cakes each morning hurries past with nervous glances.\n\nThese people don't just know you—they depend on you. The settlement exists because of your vision, your impossible knowledge, your patient years of building trust stone by stone. If you vanish now, what becomes of the neutral ground that's saved so many lives? Of the diplomatic traditions you've established? Of the young scholars who look to you not just as teacher, but as the architect of something unprecedented in Greek history?\n\nBut the device pulses with promise too—of mysteries unsolved, of eras unexplored, of the possibility that somewhere in time's vast reach, you might find your way home to that garage in Palo Alto where this all began. You've tasted one life fully. How many others await?\n\nKleander is still talking, his scarred hands gesturing at your prosperity. He has no idea he's interrupted the most important moment of your existence. The choice burns against your wrist, warm and patient and inexorable.\n\n[A] Handle Kleander's threat while protecting everything you've built, using your network of allies and accumulated influence to preserve the emporion's sacred neutrality.\n\n[B] Activate the time machine and leave this era behind, abandoning the settlement and people who trusted you but preserving your freedom to continue the journey.\n\n[C] This is my home now. I choose to stay here forever, dedicating the rest of my life to protecting what we've built together.\n\n<anchors>belonging[+35] legacy[+40] freedom[+25]</anchors>\n\n[You choose to stay forever]\nYou feel the device's warmth fade against your wrist as the decision crystallizes in your heart. The pulsing slows, dims, and finally dies—not with mechanical failure, but with the quiet finality of a door closing on one path so another may be walked fully. When you roll up your sleeve later that night, the display shows nothing but dark metal. The window has closed forever, and you are no longer a traveler between worlds but simply a man who has chosen his home.\n\nThe years that follow prove your choice wise beyond measure. Kleander's corruption scheme crumbles when you expose his network to authorities across Greece, strengthening your reputation as an incorruptible neutral arbiter. Your emporion becomes legendary—the Sacred Grove of Hermes where honest trade flourishes even as the Peloponnesian War tears the Greek world apart. Students come from as far as Sicily to study in your school, where they learn not just rhetoric and mathematics, but the radical idea that enemies can meet in peace. Aristomenes becomes more than a partner; he's the brother you chose, standing beside you through plague years and bitter winters, celebrating when former students return as ambassadors and philosophers. You never marry—some whisper it's because you loved a woman from a distant land—but you mentor dozens of young people who call you father in all but blood. Your Swiss Army knife becomes the stuff of legend among metalworkers, studied and copied though never equaled.\n\nAs decades pass and your hair turns white, the emporion evolves into something beyond your original vision. It's not just a trading post but a cultural bridge, where Persian scholars debate with Athenian philosophers, where Spartan warriors lay down arms to study poetry, where the first seeds of cosmopolitan Greek culture take root. You live to see Alexander march past your borders, carrying ideas that first flowered in your neutral ground to the edges of the known world. Former students become the diplomats who shape the Hellenistic age, carrying forward the principle that enemies need not remain enemies forever.\n\nOn your final morning, sitting in the shrine you built to a god of travelers, you feel no regret for the journey not taken. The time machine lies buried beneath the altar's foundation—you interred it there decades ago, knowing its purpose was complete. Around you, grandchildren of your first students play in gardens planted by Persian and Athenian hands alike. You built something that outlasted empires: proof that a stranger can become family, that neutrality is not indifference but love made practical, that home is not where you begin but where you choose to belong. The Far-Seer found his farthest shore in the place he finally chose to stay.\n\n<anchors>belonging[+0] legacy[+0] freedom[+0]</anchors>"

      "The world lurches sideways and your stomach drops as if you've fallen off a cliff. One moment you were in your garage in Palo Alto, the next you're stumbling onto sun-baked stone, ears ringing from the transition. The acrid smell of olive oil, sweat, and something else—human waste?—hits you like a wall. Your jeans and t-shirt feel absurdly out of place as sandaled feet shuffle past, their owners draped in rough wool and linen.\n\nYou're in some kind of marketplace. Men in short tunics argue over clay amphorae while women peer from beneath veils. The Greek you studied in college comes flooding back as you catch fragments: \"...silver from Laurion...\" \"...ships from Egypt...\" A few people stare at your strange clothes, whispering. One bearded man points and says something about \"barbarian cloth.\"\n\nYour heart hammers as you realize how exposed you are. These people have never seen denim, never seen a printed t-shirt. A small crowd begins to gather, their voices rising. Someone mentions taking you to the archons—the magistrates. You catch the word \"spy\" and \"Persian.\" The second Persian War only ended a generation ago. Being mistaken for an enemy could be fatal.\n\nA muscular man with calloused hands steps closer, speaking slowly as if to a child: \"Who are you, stranger? What polis do you serve?\" The crowd presses in, waiting for your answer. You need to respond quickly before this escalates.\n\n[A] Claim to be a traveling merchant from a distant land beyond their knowledge, hoping your strange goods will seem valuable rather than suspicious.\n\n[B] Pretend to be a shipwrecked survivor who has lost everything, appealing to Greek hospitality customs toward suppliants.\n\n[C] Present yourself as a philosopher seeking wisdom, knowing that Athens respects intellectual visitors and foreign teachers.\n\n<anchors>belonging[0] legacy[0] freedom[0]</anchors>",
      "You drop to your knees on the rough stone, arms outstretched in the formal posture of a suppliant. \"I throw myself upon your mercy,\" you cry out in halting Greek. \"My ship foundered in a storm—everything lost to Poseidon's fury. I am Xenios, cast upon your shores with nothing but my life.\"\n\nThe crowd's mood shifts instantly. Several men step back, making the sign against evil. In Greek culture, suppliants are sacred—to harm one risks the gods' wrath. The muscular man who questioned you now looks troubled rather than suspicious. \"Stranger, if you truly seek Zeus Xenios's protection...\" He glances at the others, then nods slowly. \"I am Kleomenes, potter of the Kerameikos. My wife will not forgive me if I turn away one blessed by the god of hospitality.\"\n\nOver the following weeks, your gambit pays off beyond your wildest hopes. Kleomenes and his family take you in, providing food, shelter, and rough clothing that helps you blend in. His wife Penthesilea treats you kindly but keeps her distance—proper for a woman with a strange man in the house. Their teenage son Nikias becomes fascinated by your odd accent and occasional slips into concepts that don't exist yet. You learn the rhythm of Athenian life: the agora's bustle, the workshops' hammer-song, the evening symposiums where men recline and debate philosophy over wine.\n\nBut as the season turns toward autumn, questions multiply. Other potters ask about your family, your polis, your training. Your story of shipwreck explains your lack of possessions, but not your ignorance of basic pottery techniques or your strange knowledge of distant places. When you accidentally mention concepts like \"democracy in the future\" or reference events that haven't happened yet, people exchange worried glances.\n\nOne evening, Kleomenes pulls you aside. \"Friend Xenios, there are whispers. Some say you speak like an oracle—knowing things you shouldn't know. Others wonder if you're a Persian spy with an elaborate story. I believe in your shipwreck, but you must establish yourself properly in Athens, or suspicion will grow dangerous.\"\n\n[A] Seek work in the silver mines at Laurion, where desperate men ask few questions and your strange knowledge might help you survive the brutal conditions.\n\n[B] Offer your services to the city as a foreign teacher, following the tradition of wise men like Anaxagoras who came from abroad to educate Athenian youth.\n\n[C] Approach the temple of Hephaestus near the Agora, claiming the god of craftsmanship sent you visions in dreams—explaining your odd knowledge while gaining religious protection.\n\n<anchors>belonging[+5] legacy[0] freedom[-3]</anchors>",
      "Your decision to present yourself as a teacher proves inspired. Kleomenes introduces you to Hipponikos, a wealthy citizen whose son needs tutoring in mathematics and natural philosophy. When you demonstrate your knowledge—casually explaining geometric principles that won't be \"discovered\" for decades and discussing the movements of celestial bodies with startling precision—Hipponikos's eyes widen with genuine amazement.\n\n\"By the gods,\" he whispers after you predict a lunar eclipse to the day. \"You truly are touched by divine wisdom.\" Word spreads quickly through Athens's elite circles. The foreign teacher who knows impossible things becomes the season's fascination. Wealthy families compete to hire you, and your rates climb steadily.\n\nOver the following weeks, your reputation solidifies. You're careful to frame your knowledge as \"dreams from Apollo\" or \"visions granted by Athena,\" which satisfies Greek curiosity about your impossible insights. Your students include the sons of prominent citizens—young men who will shape Athens's future. When you subtly introduce concepts of hygiene to prevent disease, or demonstrate principles of engineering that could improve their siege engines, they hang on every word.\n\nThe money flows freely now. You've moved into your own modest house near the Agora, with a slave named Thrax to manage household duties. Your success, however, draws unexpected attention. As winter approaches, a messenger arrives with an invitation that makes your blood run cold: Pericles himself requests your presence. The most powerful man in Athens has heard of the foreign teacher with impossible knowledge.\n\n\"The strategos wishes to discuss philosophy,\" the messenger explains. \"He's particularly interested in your... unique perspectives on statecraft and the future of Athens.\" But there's something in his tone that suggests this isn't merely social curiosity. Pericles is brilliant, suspicious, and utterly ruthless with threats to Athenian power.\n\n[A] Accept the invitation immediately, bringing gifts and demonstrating complete deference to avoid seeming like a threat to his authority.\n\n[B] Request a delay to properly prepare, using the time to research Pericles' current political challenges so you can offer genuinely useful advice.\n\n[C] Approach Aspasia first—as Pericles' foreign-born partner, she understands the delicate position of influential outsiders and might provide crucial guidance.\n\n<anchors>belonging[+8] legacy[+12] freedom[-5]</anchors>",
      "Your attempt to reach Aspasia proves more complicated than expected. As a foreign woman, even one of her stature, she doesn't move freely through Athens like a citizen male. Your first inquiries at symposiums are met with raised eyebrows—respectable men don't discuss seeking private audience with another man's hetaira, even one as intellectually renowned as Aspasia.\n\nWhen you finally make contact through a chain of intermediaries, the meeting itself becomes problematic. Aspasia agrees to see you, but only in the presence of other women at a religious festival honoring Demeter. The conversation must be carefully coded, speaking in metaphors about \"navigating storms\" and \"foreign seeds taking root in Attic soil.\" She's brilliant and immediately grasps your situation, but warns that your approach has already created gossip.\n\n\"Pericles has heard you sought me out before answering his summons,\" she says quietly, pretending to examine votive offerings. \"He sees this as either clever—understanding the value of counsel—or suspicious—foreign conspirators conferring in secret.\" Her dark eyes meet yours briefly. \"Your reputation for impossible knowledge already troubles him. Some whisper you're a Persian mystic sent to bewitch Athenian minds.\"\n\nOver the following weeks, the delay costs you. While you waited for the meeting with Aspasia, then processed her advice, Pericles' invitation has transformed into something more formal and less friendly. The summons now comes through official channels, couched in language that suggests investigation rather than philosophical discourse. Your students' families begin expressing quiet concerns. The wealthy Hipponikos mentions that \"certain citizens\" have questioned your loyalty to Athens.\n\nYet Aspasia's counsel proves invaluable. She's given you crucial intelligence: Pericles fears that Sparta is infiltrating Athens with foreign agents posing as teachers and philosophers. Your timing couldn't be worse—or perhaps more revealing of your true nature.\n\n[A] Present yourself to Pericles with complete honesty about your origins, gambling that the impossible truth might be more believable than any lie.\n\n[B] Offer to prove your loyalty by providing intelligence about Spartan military tactics, using your historical knowledge to give Athens genuine strategic advantages.\n\n[C] Propose hosting a public demonstration of your teaching methods in the Theater of Dionysus, letting all citizens witness your wisdom and judge your character openly—following the Athenian tradition of deciding important matters through public scrutiny.\n\n<anchors>belonging[+3] legacy[+5] freedom[-8]</anchors>",
      "Your meeting with Pericles in his private study begins promisingly. When you offer detailed knowledge of Spartan military formations—describing their phalanx tactics, the organization of their army by age groups, and weaknesses in their siege capabilities—his sharp eyes gleam with interest. But your luck sours when you reveal too much too quickly.\n\n\"Fascinating,\" Pericles says, leaning forward. \"Tell me, how does a shipwrecked teacher know that Sparta trains their warriors in groups of thirty-five, when our own spies report conflicting numbers?\" His voice grows dangerously quiet. \"And how do you know about their new iron-working techniques from the Messenian helots? That intelligence only reached us three days ago through... very specific channels.\"\n\nThe trap snaps shut around you. Your historical knowledge, meant to prove loyalty, instead reveals impossible accuracy about current military secrets. Pericles summons two guards, and suddenly you're not a honored guest but a suspected spy under house arrest. Over the following weeks, as winter deepens, investigators comb through your life in Athens. They question your students, examine your teaching methods, and press Kleomenes about your early days in the city.\n\nThe accusations multiply beyond your control. Someone claims they saw you making strange marks—your occasional notes in English alphabet. Another swears you predicted a grain shipment's arrival date with suspicious precision. Your former patron Hipponikos, fearing association with a traitor, publicly distances himself. Students' families cancel their contracts. The comfortable life you built crumbles as Athens' paranoia focuses on you.\n\nYet you're not entirely powerless. Your house arrest is loose—more surveillance than imprisonment—and you still have allies. Thrax, your household slave, remains loyal and serves as messenger. Some of your former students quietly express doubt about the charges. Aspasia, through careful intermediaries, hints that not everyone in Pericles' circle believes you're a threat.\n\n[A] Attempt to escape Athens entirely, using your knowledge of the countryside and historical events to evade pursuit and seek refuge in a neutral polis.\n\n[B] Demand trial by jury in the Athenian courts, trusting that your reputation as a teacher and the weakness of evidence might sway the democratic assembly.\n\n[C] Offer to submit to the sacred test of the Delphic Oracle, proposing that Apollo himself judge your innocence—a gambit that would either vindicate you completely or destroy you utterly.\n\n<anchors>belonging[-5] legacy[-3] freedom[-10]</anchors>",
      "Your escape from Athens begins well enough. Thrax helps you slip away during a religious procession when your watchers are distracted, and your knowledge of ancient geography serves you initially. You know which mountain passes lead to neutral territories, which roads the Athenians patrol most heavily. But your luck falters when winter storms strike earlier than expected, turning familiar paths into treacherous mud and forcing you to take shelter in villages where strangers draw unwanted attention.\n\nThe delay proves costly. In a small farming settlement near Megara, your accent and inability to explain your presence convincingly raises suspicions. The village headman, loyal to Athens and eager to curry favor, sends word of the suspicious foreigner matching the description of Pericles' escaped prisoner. By the time you realize your mistake and flee, Athenian cavalry are already riding hard along the coastal roads.\n\nOver the following weeks, you're reduced to hiding in caves and olive groves, scavenging what food you can. Your modern clothes, long since replaced by Greek garb, can't protect you from the mountain cold. The Swiss Army knife proves invaluable for survival tasks, but you're always one step ahead of pursuit. Twice you barely avoid Athenian search parties by hiding in sacred groves where soldiers won't enter after dark.\n\nAs spring arrives, your situation grows desperate rather than better. You're branded an outlaw throughout Attica, cut off from civilized shelter. Wild animals and bandits pose constant threats in the remote areas where you're forced to hide. Your smartphone's battery, even with the solar charger, runs dangerously low from overuse of the compass function during nighttime navigation.\n\nBut opportunity comes from an unexpected source. While foraging near the border with Boeotia, you encounter a group of Theban merchants whose cart has broken down. Their leader, Aristomenes, eyes you warily but seems more interested in your obvious desperation than any bounty on your head.\n\n\"You have the look of a man with nothing left to lose,\" he observes. \"Such men can be useful, if they're willing to work for honest silver rather than steal it.\"\n\n[A] Offer your services as a guide and translator for their trading expeditions, using your geographical knowledge to help them find profitable new routes.\n\n[B] Propose to teach their children and household slaves to read and write, establishing yourself as a valuable asset worth protecting from Athenian pursuit.\n\n[C] Suggest they hire you to help negotiate with the Oracle at Delphi on their behalf, knowing that your \"divine visions\" could provide the merchants with seemingly prophetic guidance for their business ventures.\n\n<anchors>belonging[-8] legacy[-5] freedom[+12]</anchors>",
      "Your gambit with Aristomenes pays off spectacularly. When you guide his caravan to a previously unknown river crossing that saves them three days of travel, then help them avoid bandits by suggesting an alternate route through sacred groves, the Theban merchant becomes convinced you're blessed by Hermes, god of travelers and trade. Your knowledge of ancient geography—where settlements will grow, which mountain passes stay clear longest—seems like divine inspiration to men who navigate by landmarks and local reputation.\n\nWithin weeks, you've become invaluable to his trading network. You lead them to deposits of high-quality clay that potters will prize, guide them to fishing villages with abundant catches perfect for inland markets, and most lucratively, direct them to communities with surplus grain just as other cities face shortages. Your smartphone's offline maps, carefully consulted in private, reveal mineral deposits and geographic features that won't be discovered for centuries.\n\nOver the following months, as spring turns to summer, your reputation spreads through Boeotian merchant circles. You're known as \"Xenios the Far-Seer,\" the foreign guide whose routes never fail. The silver flows freely—enough to buy proper clothes, weapons, and your own pack animals. More importantly, you've earned protection. When Athenian agents inquire about a fugitive teacher, Theban merchants claim they've never heard of such a man. They only know a valuable trading partner who brings them profit.\n\nThe work suits you in ways you hadn't expected. Days on mountain trails, nights around campfires sharing stories with hardened traders, the satisfaction of successful negotiations in foreign markets—it's a life of constant movement and challenge. Yet as autumn approaches, Aristomenes makes an offer that could change everything.\n\n\"The Pythian Games approach at Delphi,\" he says over evening wine. \"All the great merchants will gather, along with representatives from every polis. It's dangerous for you—Athens will have agents there—but also an opportunity. If you could guide our expedition to victory in the trade competitions, we'd all be rich beyond measure.\"\n\n[A] Accept the challenge and travel to Delphi, using your knowledge of historical events to help the merchants succeed at the games despite the risk of Athenian discovery.\n\n[B] Propose establishing a permanent trading post in a remote but strategically located valley, creating a safe base of operations while building something lasting.\n\n[C] Suggest forming an alliance with the Delphic priests by offering to interpret \"divine signs\" for pilgrims, knowing that religious sanctuary could protect you from political enemies while legitimizing your prophetic abilities.\n\n<anchors>belonging[+12] legacy[+8] freedom[+3]</anchors>",
      "Your proposal to establish a permanent trading post excites Aristomenes and his partners. You identify a perfect valley—defensible, with fresh water and natural shelter, positioned along a route that will become crucial in future conflicts. The merchants pool their silver to purchase the land from local farmers, and construction begins with high hopes. Your knowledge of engineering principles helps design storage facilities and defensive walls that impress even experienced builders.\n\nBut the venture quickly encounters problems you couldn't foresee. The local Boeotian council, initially welcoming, grows suspicious when they realize how strategically valuable your chosen location truly is. They demand additional tribute payments and impose restrictions on which goods can be stored there. Worse, the farmers you displaced prove more troublesome than expected—several have relatives in positions of minor authority who begin questioning why foreigners should control such prime territory.\n\nOver the following weeks, as winter sets in, the complications multiply. A harsh early freeze destroys much of the construction work, splitting timber and cracking newly-laid stone foundations. The costs spiral beyond the merchants' initial investment, forcing them to take on debt with Theban moneylenders at ruinous interest rates. Some of your trading partners begin grumbling that the \"Far-Seer's\" vision has led them into a costly trap.\n\nMost dangerously, the attention drawn by your ambitious project reaches unwelcome ears. A Spartan envoy, traveling through Boeotia on diplomatic business, takes particular interest in your fortified trading post so close to Attica's border. He asks pointed questions about the foreign architect who designed such sophisticated defenses. Meanwhile, Athenian merchants visiting Theban markets hear rumors of a mysterious trader whose geographical knowledge seems impossibly precise.\n\nYour time machine indicator, dark for months, suddenly pulses with faint light as you examine the half-built walls in the morning frost. The window isn't open yet, but something has changed. The device seems to respond to moments of transition, of choices that define who you become.\n\nAristomenes approaches with grim news. \"The Spartans are asking too many questions,\" he says quietly. \"And our Theban creditors grow impatient. We need a solution, friend, before this venture ruins us all.\"\n\n[A] Cut your losses and dissolve the partnership, distributing what assets remain and scattering to different cities before the political heat intensifies.\n\n[B] Double down by recruiting skilled craftsmen and former soldiers to turn the trading post into a proper fortress-town, creating something too valuable for any power to destroy.\n\n[C] Invoke the ancient Greek tradition of establishing an emporion—a neutral trading sanctuary under divine protection—by dedicating the post to Hermes and seeking recognition from the Amphictyonic League.\n\n<anchors>belonging[+8] legacy[+15] freedom[-12]</anchors>",
      "Your gambit to invoke divine protection proves moderately successful. The formal dedication to Hermes provides exactly the political cover you hoped for—neither Sparta nor Athens can openly threaten a sanctified trading post without risking the gods' wrath. The Amphictyonic League, after lengthy deliberation and generous offerings, grants limited recognition to your emporion. The sacred boundaries are marked with stone herms, and a small shrine to Hermes Agoraios rises at the settlement's heart.\n\nHowever, the process consumes months of negotiations and nearly bankrupts your merchant partners. The required offerings, ceremonial feasts, and bribes to various officials drain your remaining silver reserves. The League's recognition comes with strict limitations—you can facilitate trade but cannot store weapons or offer permanent residence to political refugees. Some of the Theban creditors remain unsatisfied, and you're forced to accept reduced profits to maintain the peace.\n\nOver the following season, as spring arrives, your emporion begins to function as intended. Merchants from across the Greek world stop to trade under Hermes' protection, and the steady flow of transaction fees slowly rebuilds your finances. Your reputation as the architect of this neutral ground spreads, though it also makes you more visible to those who would rather see you disappear. Still, the religious sanctuary provides genuine safety—even Athenian agents cannot openly move against you here.\n\nThe settlement grows modestly but steadily. Craftsmen set up workshops within the sacred boundaries, pilgrims leave offerings at the shrine, and your Swiss Army knife becomes legendary among the metalworkers who marvel at its impossible precision. Yet success brings new challenges. As your influence increases, so do expectations. Local communities look to you for arbitration in trade disputes. Neighboring poleis seek your counsel on commercial ventures.\n\nYour time machine's indicator pulses more frequently now, the light growing stronger each week. You've built something lasting, created relationships that anchor you to this time and place. But the device seems to sense your growing entanglement, responding to the depth of your commitment with increasing urgency.\n\nOne morning, Aristomenes brings troubling news. \"There's talk of war,\" he says grimly. \"Sparta masses troops, Athens recalls her fleets. When the fighting starts, even sacred ground may not protect us. We need to decide—do we prepare for siege, or find ways to profit from the coming conflict?\"\n\n[A] Transform the emporion into a neutral meeting ground where both sides can negotiate safely, positioning yourself as an essential mediator in the coming war.\n\n[B] Establish secret supply lines to provision whichever side offers better terms, using your geographical knowledge to create smuggling routes through supposedly impassable terrain.\n\n[C] Propose hosting the Hermaia festival—sacred games honoring your patron god—creating an annual tradition that would make your settlement too culturally important to attack even during wartime.\n\n<anchors>belonging[+15] legacy[+20] freedom[-8]</anchors>",
      "Your attempt to position the emporion as a neutral meeting ground begins promisingly when both Athenian and Spartan envoys agree to preliminary talks under Hermes' protection. The sacred boundaries seem to offer exactly the diplomatic sanctuary needed for delicate negotiations. But your luck sours catastrophically during the first major conference when a young Athenian diplomat—one of your former students, now grown to manhood—recognizes you despite your weathered appearance and changed circumstances.\n\n\"By the gods,\" Nikias whispers during a break in negotiations, \"you're the teacher who fled Athens. Xenios the supposed spy.\" Word spreads rapidly through both delegations. The Spartans, already suspicious of Athenian tricks, assume your presence proves the entire meeting is an elaborate trap. The Athenians, led by a hardline faction that remembers Pericles' concerns about your impossible knowledge, see confirmation of their worst fears about foreign infiltration.\n\nOver the following weeks, the diplomatic crisis spirals beyond your control. Both sides withdraw from negotiations, each blaming the other for harboring a known enemy agent. Your carefully built reputation as a neutral mediator crumbles overnight. Worse, the scandal reaches the Amphictyonic League, which begins reconsidering the emporion's sacred status. Several member cities question whether divine protection should extend to those who deceive the gods about their true nature.\n\nThe settlement itself begins to fracture under the pressure. Some merchants flee rather than face association with a suspected spy. Others, loyal to your years of successful partnership, stand by you but suffer as trade routes dry up. Aristomenes grows haggard trying to manage creditors who see the political chaos as excuse to call in debts immediately.\n\nYour time machine's indicator now pulses almost continuously, the light growing brighter with each passing day. The device seems to sense the collapse of everything you've built here, responding to your diminishing ties with increasing urgency to escape. Yet people still depend on you—craftsmen who invested their life savings, families who've made homes within the sacred boundaries, partnerships forged over months of shared hardship.\n\nStanding in the shrine at dawn, watching the morning light catch the bronze of Hermes' statue, you realize you've reached a crossroads that will define not just your survival, but who you choose to be.\n\n[A] Make a public confession of your true origins to both Athenian and Spartan representatives, gambling that the impossible truth might restore your credibility as a neutral party.\n\n[B] Secretly contact the Delphic Oracle and arrange for a \"divine revelation\" that vouches for your character, using your historical knowledge to craft prophecies that will seem authentically inspired.\n\n[C] Activate the time machine now, before the situation deteriorates further, abandoning the settlement and people who trusted you to preserve your own freedom.\n\n<anchors>belonging[+20] legacy[+25] freedom[-15]</anchors>",
      "Your clandestine journey to Delphi proves masterfully executed. Using your knowledge of the Oracle's operations—how the Pythia delivers prophecies, when the sacred vapors are strongest, which priests control access—you arrange a private consultation that appears entirely legitimate. Your carefully crafted \"divine revelations\" blend perfect historical accuracy with vague enough language to seem authentically oracular. You predict the exact timing of a Corinthian grain shortage, reference specific Spartan military movements that won't be public knowledge for weeks, and most convincingly, describe Athenian naval operations with impossible precision.\n\nThe Pythia, whether genuinely inspired or simply impressed by your uncanny accuracy, delivers a thunderous pronouncement that echoes throughout the Greek world: \"The stranger called Xenios serves truth itself. He who questions his neutrality questions the gods' wisdom. Let all who seek honest commerce find sanctuary in his sacred ground.\" The Oracle's validation carries such weight that even your former accusers must publicly accept it or risk appearing impious.\n\nOver the following months, as autumn deepens into winter, your vindication transforms from religious pronouncement into political reality. The same Athenian diplomat who recognized you now speaks grudgingly of divine intervention. Spartan representatives, deeply reverent of oracular pronouncements, begin treating you with newfound respect. The Amphictyonic League not only reaffirms your emporion's sacred status but grants expanded privileges, allowing you to host official diplomatic meetings under Apollo's protection as well as Hermes'.\n\nTrade returns in force as confidence rebuilds. Your settlement becomes the premier neutral ground for inter-polis negotiations, with permanent ambassadors from major cities establishing residences within the sacred boundaries. The fees from diplomatic services, combined with renewed commercial activity, make you wealthier than your teaching days in Athens ever did. More importantly, you've created something unprecedented—a truly neutral space in a world increasingly divided by the approaching war.\n\nYour time machine's pulsing has grown urgent, the light now bright enough to see even in daylight. The device seems to recognize that you've reached a pinnacle of achievement here, your influence spreading throughout the Greek world. Yet this success has also created the deepest bonds you've ever formed—not just business partnerships, but genuine friendships forged through shared crisis and triumph.\n\nAs you stand in the expanded shrine, now adorned with offerings from across Greece, Aristomenes approaches with news that crystallizes the moment of choice: \"The Great War has begun in earnest. Athens and Sparta both request our services as the primary neutral ground for prisoner exchanges and peace negotiations. We'll be at the center of history itself.\"\n\n[A] Accept the role as the war's primary neutral mediator, knowing your historical knowledge could help end the conflict years early and save countless lives.\n\n[B] Gradually withdraw from active mediation while maintaining the emporion's neutral status, focusing on preserving what you've built rather than risking it in the larger conflict.\n\n[C] Use your influence to quietly evacuate non-combatants from cities you know will face siege, establishing refugee camps under religious protection without revealing how you know which places will fall.\n\n<anchors>belonging[+25] legacy[+30] freedom[-20]</anchors>",
      "Your decision to step back from active mediation while maintaining the emporion's neutrality proves wise and sustainable. You delegate the most sensitive diplomatic meetings to trusted associates while remaining available for consultation, creating a buffer between yourself and the war's most dangerous political currents. The arrangement works smoothly—both sides respect your sacred ground while you avoid the impossible position of trying to broker peace between powers destined for decades of conflict.\n\nOver the following seasons, your careful withdrawal allows the settlement to flourish in ways direct involvement might have prevented. Free from the pressure of constant high-stakes negotiations, you focus on developing the emporion's infrastructure and community. New workshops spring up within the sacred boundaries, a small but excellent school attracts students from across Greece, and your trading network expands to include routes reaching as far as the Black Sea colonies.\n\nThe war rages around your neutral sanctuary, but your measured approach keeps the settlement prosperous and safe. You facilitate prisoner exchanges and occasional truces without claiming credit for grand diplomacy. Your former students, now grown to positions of influence in various cities, quietly send their own children to study at your school. The fees from diplomatic services remain steady, while expanded trade brings wealth without the constant threat of political miscalculation.\n\nYet as winter approaches, marking nearly a full year since the war began, you face an unexpected challenge. Your success in remaining neutral has attracted attention from those who profit from prolonged conflict. A group of arms dealers and mercenary captains, led by a scarred Corinthian named Kleander, approaches with a proposition that's barely disguised as a threat.\n\n\"Neutrality is profitable,\" Kleander says, examining the shrine's expensive offerings with calculating eyes. \"But imagine how much more profitable the right kind of... selective neutrality could be. Certain information about enemy movements, strategic delays in prisoner exchanges, temporary equipment storage for the highest bidder.\"\n\nYour time machine pulses steadily now, its light so bright that you sometimes notice it even through your sleeve during daylight hours. The window hasn't opened yet, but something fundamental is shifting. The device seems to sense that your current stability, however comfortable, may not last indefinitely.\n\n[A] Firmly reject their proposition and strengthen your defenses, relying on religious sanctuary and allied merchants to protect your genuine neutrality.\n\n[B] Pretend to consider their offer while secretly gathering information about their network to expose them to the proper authorities in multiple cities.\n\n[C] Invoke the ancient tradition of the Sacred Truce by declaring a permanent hieros topos around your settlement, seeking recognition from the Olympic authorities that would make any violation a crime against all Greeks.\n\n<anchors>belonging[+15] legacy[+20] freedom[-10]</anchors>",
      "[The time machine window opens]\nThe device against your wrist grows warm—not uncomfortably so, but with the unmistakable pulse you've learned to recognize. As Kleander continues outlining his corrupt proposition, you feel the familiar thrum against your skin, see the faint glow even through your sleeve. The small display shows the date clearly: -431, Classical Athens. The window is open.\n\nYour mind races as the Corinthian talks. Around you stands everything you've built—the bustling workshops where craftsmen create beauty that will outlast empires, the school where young minds wrestle with ideas that will shape philosophy for millennia, the shrine where honest merchants find sanctuary from a world gone mad with war. Aristomenes catches your eye from across the courtyard, concern creasing his weathered face as he watches this unwelcome delegation. Students pause in their exercises, sensing tension. The cook who makes your favorite barley cakes each morning hurries past with nervous glances.\n\nThese people don't just know you—they depend on you. The settlement exists because of your vision, your impossible knowledge, your patient years of building trust stone by stone. If you vanish now, what becomes of the neutral ground that's saved so many lives? Of the diplomatic traditions you've established? Of the young scholars who look to you not just as teacher, but as the architect of something unprecedented in Greek history?\n\nBut the device pulses with promise too—of mysteries unsolved, of eras unexplored, of the possibility that somewhere in time's vast reach, you might find your way home to that garage in Palo Alto where this all began. You've tasted one life fully. How many others await?\n\nKleander is still talking, his scarred hands gesturing at your prosperity. He has no idea he's interrupted the most important moment of your existence. The choice burns against your wrist, warm and patient and inexorable.\n\n[A] Handle Kleander's threat while protecting everything you've built, using your network of allies and accumulated influence to preserve the emporion's sacred neutrality.\n\n[B] Activate the time machine and leave this era behind, abandoning the settlement and people who trusted you but preserving your freedom to continue the journey.\n\n[C] This is my home now. I choose to stay here forever, dedicating the rest of my life to protecting what we've built together.\n\n<anchors>belonging[+35] legacy[+40] freedom[+25]</anchors>",
      "[You choose to stay forever]\nYou feel the device's warmth fade against your wrist as the decision crystallizes in your heart. The pulsing slows, dims, and finally dies—not with mechanical failure, but with the quiet finality of a door closing on one path so another may be walked fully. When you roll up your sleeve later that night, the display shows nothing but dark metal. The window has closed forever, and you are no longer a traveler between worlds but simply a man who has chosen his home.\n\nThe years that follow prove your choice wise beyond measure. Kleander's corruption scheme crumbles when you expose his network to authorities across Greece, strengthening your reputation as an incorruptible neutral arbiter. Your emporion becomes legendary—the Sacred Grove of Hermes where honest trade flourishes even as the Peloponnesian War tears the Greek world apart. Students come from as far as Sicily to study in your school, where they learn not just rhetoric and mathematics, but the radical idea that enemies can meet in peace. Aristomenes becomes more than a partner; he's the brother you chose, standing beside you through plague years and bitter winters, celebrating when former students return as ambassadors and philosophers. You never marry—some whisper it's because you loved a woman from a distant land—but you mentor dozens of young people who call you father in all but blood. Your Swiss Army knife becomes the stuff of legend among metalworkers, studied and copied though never equaled.\n\nAs decades pass and your hair turns white, the emporion evolves into something beyond your original vision. It's not just a trading post but a cultural bridge, where Persian scholars debate with Athenian philosophers, where Spartan warriors lay down arms to study poetry, where the first seeds of cosmopolitan Greek culture take root. You live to see Alexander march past your borders, carrying ideas that first flowered in your neutral ground to the edges of the known world. Former students become the diplomats who shape the Hellenistic age, carrying forward the principle that enemies need not remain enemies forever.\n\nOn your final morning, sitting in the shrine you built to a god of travelers, you feel no regret for the journey not taken. The time machine lies buried beneath the altar's foundation—you interred it there decades ago, knowing its purpose was complete. Around you, grandchildren of your first students play in gardens planted by Persian and Athenian hands alike. You built something that outlasted empires: proof that a stranger can become family, that neutrality is not indifference but love made practical, that home is not where you begin but where you choose to belong. The Far-Seer found his farthest shore in the place he finally chose to stay.\n\n<anchors>belonging[+0] legacy[+0] freedom[+0]</anchors>"

        "narrative": "The world lurches sideways and you slam into dusty earth, your stomach heaving as reality snaps back into focus. The acrid smell of motor oil and coal smoke fills your nostrils. Through blurred vision, you see railroad tracks stretching toward low California hills, and beyond them—a massive industrial complex belching black smoke into a pale sky.\n\nYou struggle to your feet, brushing dirt from your jeans and hoodie. A steam whistle screams across the valley. In the distance, figures in work clothes stream through factory gates. The sun hangs differently than it should, and everything feels wrong—the air thinner, the colors muted like an old photograph come to life.\n\n\"Hey! You there!\" A gruff voice cuts through your disorientation. A railroad worker in coveralls approaches, his face suspicious beneath a cloth cap. \"What's your business here? You look like you been rode hard and put up wet.\" His eyes narrow at your strange clothes. \"Name's Murphy. You got papers? We had word about saboteurs coming through—Jerry spies and such.\"\n\nYour heart pounds. This man clearly thinks you're some kind of threat. Behind him, other workers have stopped loading freight cars to stare. A woman in a kerchief and work pants points in your direction, whispering to her companions. The factory whistle sounds again, urgent and demanding.\n\n[A] Claim you're a migrant worker from back East, looking for factory work—lots of people moving around for war jobs\n\n[B] Say you're a traveling preacher who lost your belongings, appeal to their Christian charity\n\n[C] Tell them you're a journalist documenting the home front war effort, pull out your phone as a \"recording device\"\n\n\n\nMurphy's eyes narrow as you stammer about being from back East, looking for work. \"Back East, huh?\" He spits into the dirt. \"Funny thing—my cousin Joe works personnel at Douglas Aircraft. Says they been getting a flood of drifters claiming to be from places they ain't never been.\" He steps closer, studying your clothes with growing suspicion. \"And what's this fabric? Feels like nothing I ever seen.\"\n\nBehind him, the other workers murmur among themselves. One shouts, \"Check his hands, Murphy! Real workers got calluses!\" Your soft, modern hands betray you instantly. Murphy grabs your wrist, examining your palms. \"Smooth as a baby's bottom. You ain't worked a day of honest labor in your life, have you, boy?\"\n\nOver the following weeks, your story unravels completely. Word spreads through the tight-knit community—there's a suspicious character asking around for work with no references, no draft card, and clothes that don't make sense. The local sheriff starts asking questions. Landlords won't rent to you. Even the soup kitchen volunteers eye you warily.\n\nWinter settles over California's Central Valley, and you find yourself sleeping rough more often than not. Your modern jacket keeps you warmer than the locals expect, which only adds to their suspicions. You've managed to find occasional day labor—loading trucks, moving freight—but nothing steady. The ibuprofen has been a godsend when your back aches from sleeping on the ground.\n\nMurphy corners you again outside the rail yard one gray February morning. \"Look here, stranger. I don't know what your game is, but the FBI's been sniffing around asking about suspicious characters. Time for you to move along before real trouble finds you.\"\n\n[A] Head to Los Angeles where you can disappear in the crowds and find factory work\n\n[B] Approach the local Catholic church—priests help displaced people, and you could claim to be a refugee\n\n[C] Offer to help families with their Victory Gardens using your \"agricultural knowledge\" from back East\n\n\n\nThe freight train to Los Angeles costs you three days' wages, but the anonymity feels worth it. You huddle in a corner of the boxcar with other drifters—men with hollow eyes and patched clothes, all chasing rumors of work in the aircraft factories. They share stories of Douglas, Lockheed, North American Aviation. \"They're hiring anyone with two hands,\" mutters an older man missing his left thumb. \"War's got 'em desperate.\"\n\nLos Angeles sprawls before you like nothing you've ever seen—endless neighborhoods of small houses stretching toward distant mountains. The air tastes of oil and dust and ocean salt. Over the following weeks, you manage what thousands of others have done: you disappear into the mass of humanity flowing toward the war plants.\n\nDouglas Aircraft takes you on at their Long Beach facility after a cursory interview. Your story about being from back East works better here—everyone's from somewhere else. The work is dangerous and loud: riveting aluminum sheets for A-20 attack bombers destined for the Pacific. The noise makes your ears ring for hours after each shift. You've used the ibuprofen twice for headaches that felt like your skull might split.\n\nYour supervisor, a tough woman named Betty who chain-smokes Lucky Strikes, barely looks up from her clipboard when she assigns you to Wing Assembly. \"Keep up or ship out,\" she says. \"We're building freedom, not taking a Sunday stroll.\"\n\nAs spring arrives, you've settled into a routine. You rent a cot in a boarding house with five other men, all working different shifts at different plants. The money's decent—$40 a week—but everything costs more than you expected. Food, rent, even a cup of coffee takes a bigger bite than it should.\n\n[A] Join the workers pushing for better safety conditions after seeing too many accidents\n\n[B] Volunteer for the swing shift premium pay to save money and avoid socializing\n\n[C] Befriend the Nisei workers who returned from the camps to prove their loyalty through war work\n\n\n\nThe swing shift pays time-and-a-half, and you grab it eagerly. Working 4 PM to midnight means fewer supervisors breathing down your neck and blessed solitude in the boarding house while your roommates work days. You keep your head down, do your work, bank your money.\n\nFortune smiles on your strategy in ways you never expected. Three weeks into the new schedule, you witness a hydraulic press malfunction that would have crushed Jimmy Kowalski if you hadn't yanked him clear. The plant manager, Mr. Henderson, personally shakes your hand and mentions your \"sharp eyes and quick thinking\" in the company newsletter. More importantly, he moves you to final inspection—cleaner work, better pay, and a reputation as someone who notices details.\n\nAs summer deepens, your savings grow to nearly $200—more money than most of your roommates see in six months. The night shift suits your strange situation perfectly. You use your smartphone's flashlight during dark inspections, claiming it's a \"special torch from back East.\" Nobody questions the man who saved Jimmy's life.\n\nThe real windfall comes in July. Henderson approaches you after shift with an unusual proposal. \"Listen, we've got a problem. Night shift quality inspector quit to join the Navy. Job pays $65 a week, but it means responsibility—signing off on planes that boys will fly into combat. You interested?\"\n\nYour quiet competence and growing reputation have opened a door you never expected. The promotion would mean real money, respect, and influence over production. But it also means your signature on every inspection report—permanent records that could be scrutinized later.\n\n[A] Accept the promotion and use the position to subtly improve aircraft safety with your modern knowledge\n\n[B] Take the job but stay invisible—just do exactly what's expected and nothing more\n\n[C] Politely decline and suggest they promote Jimmy Kowalski instead, citing his seniority\n\n\n\nYou accept Henderson's offer with barely contained excitement. The $65 weekly salary feels like a fortune, but more importantly, you see a chance to save lives. Your smartphone's Wikipedia contains detailed articles about aircraft structural failures, metallurgy, and inspection techniques decades ahead of 1943 standards.\n\nThe problems start almost immediately. Your first week as night inspector, you flag three A-20s for what you call \"stress fractures in critical load-bearing joints\"—hairline cracks your modern knowledge tells you will propagate into catastrophic failures. The day shift supervisor, a grizzled engineer named Walsh, reviews your reports with growing irritation.\n\n\"Where'd you learn to spot these so-called fractures?\" he demands during a heated meeting with Henderson. \"These planes passed three previous inspections. Now you're telling me my boys don't know their business?\" Your suggestions about \"improved metallurgical analysis\" and \"fatigue testing protocols\" sound increasingly hollow when you can't explain where you learned such advanced concepts.\n\nOver the following weeks, the situation deteriorates. Walsh starts double-checking your work, finding excuses to reject your recommendations. Other inspectors whisper that the new guy thinks he's smarter than engineers with decades of experience. Your rejection rate climbs to nearly double the plant average, slowing production and drawing unwanted attention from management.\n\nHenderson calls you in as autumn approaches. \"Look, I know you mean well, but Walsh is breathing down my neck. Corporate's asking questions about production delays in our sector. Maybe dial back the perfectionism a notch? These birds have been flying combat missions for months without the problems you're finding.\"\n\nThe weight of compromise settles heavy on your shoulders. You know those hairline cracks will kill people, but pushing too hard threatens everything you've built here.\n\n[A] Quietly document the defects you find but stop fighting the system—focus on the most critical safety issues only\n\n[B] Request a transfer to a different department where your knowledge might be less conspicuous\n\n[C] Approach the plant's union representatives about safety concerns—workers have more credibility than management pets\n\n\n\nYou swallow your pride and dial back your inspections, focusing only on the most critical defects. The strategy feels like a betrayal of everything you know, but you document every compromise in a private notebook, telling yourself that saving some lives is better than saving none.\n\nThe plan backfires spectacularly. In October, an A-20 you passed with \"minor acceptable stress points\" crashes during a test flight over the Mojave. The pilot, Lieutenant Morrison, dies when the wing section you'd flagged but approved finally fails. The Army Air Forces launches an immediate investigation, and your inspection records become evidence in what everyone knows will be a court-martial for someone.\n\nWalsh wastes no time throwing you under the bus. \"This new inspector's been flagging issues then passing planes anyway,\" he tells the investigating officers. \"Inconsistent, unreliable. I warned Henderson about promoting him too fast.\" Your careful documentation becomes proof of negligence rather than diligence—why approve something you knew was dangerous?\n\nOver the following weeks, the investigation expands. Your background gets scrutinized more carefully than ever before. Where exactly did you work back East? Which plants? The FBI agent asking questions has sharp eyes and a way of making simple queries feel like accusations. Your roommates start avoiding you. Even Jimmy Kowalski won't meet your eyes.\n\nHenderson calls you into his office on a gray November morning. The termination letter sits on his desk between you. \"I'm sorry,\" he says, and sounds like he means it. \"Corporate wants you gone. The Army wants you gone. I've got no choice.\" He slides an envelope across the desk. \"Two weeks' severance. Get out clean, and we'll call it a resignation.\"\n\nYour savings will last maybe two months if you're careful. Winter's coming, and word of your \"involvement\" in the Morrison crash will follow you to any aircraft plant in California.\n\n[A] Head to the shipyards in San Pedro—they're hiring welders and asking fewer questions about backgrounds\n\n[B] Try to enlist in the Army—military service would clear your reputation and provide steady pay\n\n[C] Go to San Francisco's Chinatown where a diverse community might be more accepting of outsiders\n\n\n\nThe bus to San Francisco costs you twelve dollars you can't afford to lose. You arrive in Chinatown with a duffel bag and desperate hope, expecting to find the diverse, accepting community you imagined. Instead, you discover a neighborhood under siege.\n\nThe Chinese Exclusion Act has been the law for sixty years, and wartime paranoia has made things worse. Every Chinese face on the street might be a spy, according to the newspapers. The community has turned inward, suspicious of any outsider—especially a white man with no connections asking too many questions. Your inquiries about work or lodging are met with polite but firm rejections. \"Very sorry, no room,\" becomes the refrain you hear at every door.\n\nOver the following weeks, your situation deteriorates rapidly. The few jobs you find—washing dishes in basement restaurants, loading trucks in back alleys—pay a fraction of what you made at Douglas. Worse, your strange mannerisms and occasional anachronistic comments mark you as different even among the desperate. When you mention \"stress analysis\" while helping unload crates, the dock supervisor eyes you suspiciously. \"You sound like one of them college boys. What's your angle here?\"\n\nBy January, your savings have dwindled to thirty-seven dollars. The boarding house you found charges weekly, and you're behind on rent. The landlord, an elderly Chinese man named Mr. Chen, speaks broken English but his meaning is clear: \"Pay now or go away.\" You've been living on rice and whatever scraps you can afford, using ibuprofen to dull the constant hunger headaches.\n\nThe final blow comes when two FBI agents show up at Chen's boarding house. Word of your background has followed you north. They don't arrest you, but their questions about your \"activities in Los Angeles\" and \"suspicious technical knowledge\" ensure that even your meager dishwashing job disappears within days.\n\n[A] Head to the docks and try to sign onto a merchant marine vessel—dangerous but it pays well and gets you away from scrutiny\n\n[B] Seek out the local Catholic mission that feeds the hungry—priests don't ask many questions and might help\n\n[C] Find the Chinese tong leaders who run illegal gambling and might value someone willing to work outside the law\n\n\n\n[The time machine window opens]\nThe San Francisco docks reek of diesel fuel and rotting fish. You approach the hiring office with your last shred of hope, only to find a line of experienced seamen stretching around the block. When your turn finally comes, the harbormaster takes one look at your soft hands and laughs. \"Merchant marine ain't a refuge for landlubbers, son. These Liberty ships are heading into U-boat waters. I need men who won't freeze up when the torpedoes start flying.\"\n\nYour desperation shows too clearly. The few captains willing to talk ask pointed questions about your background, and word of the FBI visits has somehow reached even here. \"Heard you had some trouble down south,\" one grizzled captain mutters. \"Can't afford passengers with baggage, not when we're carrying ammunition to Murmansk.\"\n\nOver the following weeks, you exhaust every option on the waterfront. Your money runs out completely. You sleep in doorways, scavenge food from dumpsters behind restaurants, and watch your reflection grow gaunt in shop windows. The California winter cuts through your modern jacket with surprising bite. You've used the last of your ibuprofen on the constant ache in your bones from sleeping on concrete.\n\nThen, on a fog-shrouded February morning as you huddle behind a fish processing plant, the device on your wrist begins to pulse with soft, urgent light. The familiar warmth spreads through the metal, and the small display flickers to life. A window has opened—your chance to escape this era's grinding poverty and suspicion.\n\nYou think of what you'd leave behind: nothing but failure and painful lessons. No one here would miss you. Mr. Chen probably wouldn't even notice you were gone. The few people who know your name associate it with disaster and questions they don't want to answer.\n\n[A] Activate the time machine and leave this era behind\n\n[B] Stay and try to rebuild from nothing—maybe find work in the Central Valley farms where fewer questions are asked, window will remain open a little longer\n\n[C] Stay and head south to Mexico where your strange background might matter less—the window will remain open a little longer\n\n\n\n[You activate the time machine]\nYour fingers find the warm metal beneath your sleeve. The device pulses against your skin like a second heartbeat, offering escape from this life of hunger and suspicion.\n\nThrough the morning fog, you glimpse Mr. Chen sweeping his front steps three blocks away. For a moment, you imagine a different choice—staying, earning his trust, maybe finding belonging in that close-knit community despite the barriers. You think of Jimmy Kowalski, probably still working the day shift at Douglas, still grateful for the split-second that saved his life. Morrison's widow, who'll never know your name or the weight you carry.\n\nBut the cold concrete beneath you and the gnawing emptiness in your stomach make the choice inevitable. You press the activation sequence.\n\nThe world blurs into streaks of gray and gold. The smell of fish and diesel fades. The device works with clean precision, reality folding around you like origami. San Francisco, 1943, and all its grinding disappointments vanish.\n\nYou're gone.\n\n"
